Unfortunately, the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer
possible to cut/paste within one sedit window, some intermediate client
always must be used (except in the rare case where you want to select
some text, and then paste it at the same place).
So, the vast majority of people probably want that ""Paste Sets Insert""
enabled - that one you can learn to live with, the other is much more
painful.
For a long time I have used an external editor with exmh (gvim).
I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
gvim processes, but not into anything else.
This is VERY annoying.
  (I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a
  terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often.  And
  if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
  up with all that raw garbage too).
Anyway to fix this?
(BTW: standard i386 redhat7.3)
Thanks.

"Hi,
You can make $50,000 or more in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
Seem impossible? Is there a catch?  NO, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.
Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then
people send me CASH in the mail for information that I just e-mail
back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.
Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you
like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.
""AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION""
""Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS
TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following.
This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money.
The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home.
The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will
understand once you experience it.
""HERE IT IS BELOW""
*** Print This Now For Future Reference ***
The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in

($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!!
THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.
It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house
except to get the mail.
Simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this
happen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if
you put in the effort to make it work. E-mail is the sales tool of
the future. Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW!
The longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your
business using e-mail. Get what is rightfully yours. Program
yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but
it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief
system in place.
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods.
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.
You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work.
The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!""
With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business.
Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others.
The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.
My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my
business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened
in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!
In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's
prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. All of the programs
I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one
year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!
But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!
After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it
correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.
I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN
LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT.""
Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am
telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I
promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me.
Here is the basic version of what you need to do:
Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND
OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.
Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2
within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.
Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.
Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.
In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT
#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,
1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done.
By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more
than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!
In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,
I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security.
If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke
P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!
A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur.
Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working.
Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945.
I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.
The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor.
As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.""
The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that.
You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK"" and ""JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined.
Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them!
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach.
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW!
""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody
Jacobs, Richmond, VA
HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$
This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.
Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE
FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do it privately in your own home, store, or office.
This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do.
1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell
them if you don't have them).
* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &
RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).
*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF
ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!
* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them.
* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.
2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.
a. Look below for the listing of available reports.
b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement
and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!
c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.
d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.
e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3
f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.
g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.
Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy
and paste method works well,.
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction
portion of this letter.
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet
Connection and e-mail is FREE!
To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.
Here are two primary methods of building your downline:
METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. Using a good list, the response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order REPORT #2.
Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about
level five!  That's $500,000 alone!
Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that and more!
REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software.
METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.
Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10
downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING
results below:
1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000
THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants.
THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!
AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND
NAME ***
* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of
those sheets of paper include:
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******
* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately.
* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the requested product/report.
* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!
* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?
Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when
they email you, send them this report in response!
If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.
Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders
for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business!
Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program:
1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO

WORLD!
5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS
YOUR TIME!
6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS
PURE PROFIT!
7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.
******* TESTIMONIALS*******
This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm
living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR
My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that
I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer
now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more
years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.
The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in.
-Charles Morris, Esq.
Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA
I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA
This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will

=========================================
Investment in technology that will make you money.
=========================================
 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home? A one time
investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars let's get you on the road to financial success.
 
ALL THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !
===========================================
BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet,
a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation
of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The
show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting
the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions,
they are bound to make some mega bucks with only$25 out of pocket cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
 
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached
many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my
astonishment, I received a total of $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.
""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
============================================
 
Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never
believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble
my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and voila ..... 3 weeks later the money
started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that
I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program,
I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.''
More testimonials later but first,
 
=PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE=
 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably,
please read the following.................THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====
 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU
ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears
ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. You will
need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to
the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports
and keep them on your desk in case something happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report,
or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step
'' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way
this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method
has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work
this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the
       name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
       the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE
       you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!
 
============================================
 
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing
your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable
marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands
of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
 
============================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and
those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%.
Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that
is only 10 orders for report # 1.  
 
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2%
response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out.
The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for report #4. Those 10,000 people send out
5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that
is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. 
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
           Your total income in this example is:
 
                  1..... $50 +
                  2..... $500 +
                  3..... $5,000 +
                  4..... $50,000 +
                  5..... $500,000
                  Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE IT OUT!
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE
IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
 
============================================
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT
OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone
or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over
150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more! METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
 
============================================
Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive,
all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service
on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report.
 
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ============
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper,
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS
and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue
       sending e-mails until you do.
 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive
        100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or
        sending e-mails until you do.
 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN RELAX,
       because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in !
       THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the
       list, you are placed in front of a Different report. You can KEEP TRACK of your
       PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT
       TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND
       START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can
       generate from this business !!!
 
============================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have
just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and
address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as instructed above. One of the
|people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be
on every one of them.
 
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customer you will reach.
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become
financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
======== MORE TESTIMONIALS ============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major
U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge
of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless
fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work.
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have
joined Jody in her ''hobby''. Mitchell Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois
==========================================
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate
in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that
there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''.
'' I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so
big."" Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
===========================================
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given
it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was
e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did
not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within
22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
============================================
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed
the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first
month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanks to the internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to
just doing

seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via ""busy"")
Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).

"Dear Sir.
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.
I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.
We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 
If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.
Yours faithfully,
DR MARKUS PHILLIPS.

"Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.
More details about these are at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/
None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.
POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.
It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.
Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.
In detail, he wrote:
Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally
catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for
nontrivial apps? No way!
Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
performance.
OK, so they do it with signals or a flag, which is completely
ghetto, but at least they are trying. Keep trying guys, you got the
idea, but not the clue.
Readers can judge who lacks the clue here.
The Windows I/O model does definately [sic] blow the doors off the
UNIX one, but then they had select to point at in it's [sic]
suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX is just
now looking at it's [sic] I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API
comes out of it.
Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.
Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.
Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned
out to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep
looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look""
is not really working so great anymore.
Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
polls them.
I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

"Thank you Lars for your reply to my query.
SA doesnt do any of these. It is probably a function of whatever scanning
system/MDA
you're using (amavis, procmail, whatever). What exactly are you using?
I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail
as the MTA). It integrates nicely in there, and shares a configuration file
with SA. All very neat.
SA in itself does nothing really. You need a frontend (procmail, amavis,
etc)
at some point in the  mail delivery chain that can hand over the message
to SA and do whatever other processing you want.
I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.
Again, many thanks,

My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be less
ambitious. The idea is that you *never* commit - instead, you simply revert
to base state on reboot. Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that
accrue important state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.
But in your typical web application, most partitions do not accrue important
state. For example, your typical web server or application server could have
their entire state reset back to a known base state during each reboot
without harm.
The advantage of being less ambitious is that we have a quick and easy way
to frustrate certain attacks without rewriting all of our software or
spending lots of money on additional application-specific coding.

The first two problems you describe only occur if we become more ambitious
and try to apply these same techniques to, for example, the database table
partitions, where state changes remain important across reboots. That would
certainly be a nice touch! But as you point out, many problems would have to
be addressed first, and the hardest of these can not be abstracted away from
the particular application. Not the least of these is the problem of writing
heuristics for delineating good from malevolent state. That task is roughly
analogous to what antiviral software authors do for a living, only this work
could not be shared across many different systems as it would be specific to
a paritcular application.

The third problem you mention - performance penalty - is an argument for
doing this in hardware, much like hardware raid. Another argument for doing
this in hardware is hack resistance. Changing the base instance should
require physical access to the console, e.g. by requiring that you first
flip a physical switch on your RAID hardware or modify a bios setting. If
the base image can be modified remotely or by software, then you have to
worry about whether an implementation flaw might permit a cracker to modify
the base image remotely.

My sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to

Actually, this issue used to escalate into a religious war. The ""From "" 
envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that 
perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in
mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with 
""From "". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail 
transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body 
alone.
Things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message 
body.
Also, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, 
the UUCP envelope) isn't just any line beginning with ""From "". It's really 
""From"", a single space, a valid email address, two spaces, and a valid 
date.

"Hi,
Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.
Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/
I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/
Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))
I think I'll use this ""--with <whatever>"" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.
As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)

  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,

Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...

    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }

which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...
Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
removed.  (I think.)
It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.
That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
are actually reread from disk.
My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
investigate that.

Zimbabwe eases GM stance
Zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.
But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of
checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.
There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative
export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are
GM-free.
Aid
Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
""The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region,"" Mr Morris told journalists.
""It will enable us to do our job,"" he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.

=== Scissors === 
I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 
    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 
She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 
I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. 
*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  
=== Waiting for Wireless === 
Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 
=== Irony === 
According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. 
I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 
Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. 
=== Automatic Flush Toilets === 
Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. 
This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. 
=== Arrival === 
I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. 
Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)",0,0

I've never heard of any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive having problems with DMA...

Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
drives with known DMA issues as well.
Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)
Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.
I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting
the DMA tip in the %description :-)
My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
""kudzu-speak"". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
having that media currently in the drive.

Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
you
Dreamweaver users
out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to
check 'em out too
.
As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
switched cell phones to the
Kyocera QCP6035
. 
The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
driving directions.
Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

phpMyNewsletter
http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/
As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
mySQL are useful in getting this installed.

OpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP
http://www.opalis.com
Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
by not having this software.

Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I

GnomeUSABILITY
http://diveintomark.org/
Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
be able to make every site you design more user friendly.
GnomeBLOG
Backend.UserLand.Com
http://backend.userland.com/
I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
discussion forum for trading ideas.

Date: Not supplied
Blake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""
Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.
To cover the list specifically:
- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.
- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.
- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.
- Message display - Yes. No argument here.
- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.
- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).
- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.
- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)
- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.
- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.
If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.  
Cheers,

"--------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is MIME?
MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the
standard for how to send multipart, multimedia, and binary data using the
world-wide Internet email system.  Typical uses of MIME include sending
images, audio, wordprocessing documents, programs, or even plain text
files when it is important that the mail system does not modify any part
of the file.  MIME also allows for labelling message parts so that a
recipient (or mail program) may determine what to do with them. 
How can I read a MIME message?
Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)
In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! 
There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 
Does MIME replace UUENCODE?
Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. 
How can I learn more about MIME?
The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
                                                       
     o  US East Coast                            
        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)

Right.  Because Americans are the only people capable of being
assholes.  Shit.  History keeps fucking up when they keep mentioning
all the historical examples of dickhead-ness that have proceeded the
US.
After all, we're the only country who gets unruly when it comes to
issues.   Thats why its always just the Americans at those crazy WTO
meetings...  Right, Owen?
 
A flippant remark that I will probably regret  - sure there's assholes 
everywhere. I just remember a lunch in Spain with
a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the 
table, and he managed to insult each of them within
15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires - 
Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce
 a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more 
likely to have them in positions of authority).

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software
Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.
Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.
In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.
Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.
On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).
Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest
San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.
Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.
In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!
Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.
Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.
The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans
Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.
When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm
Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

=======================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:
“To whom it may concern,
I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70’s & 80’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?
Sincerely,
RJ”

“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.”

Location: West Coast, USA
“I’m a man of my 40’s and I really know my stuff.  I don’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple “3”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!”

=======================================================Finally, we realize of course that this Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive…. (Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and “sweetness” is never acquired inexpensively.  Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craft….  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM)…. Four or five draws of your pipe….as is the magical way….lingers for a good, goodly while!!!  (An herb pipe and usage instructions are included with each Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) Package.)

"Wrong, [VMS-like async io] makes a huge difference in even what I
consider small programs.
So it sounds as if, to your thinking,
most useful apps are also trivial. 
Unless each key on my keyboard were
(to the apps) distinct event sources,
I can't think of any of my usual job
mix that would need hundreds, or even
tens, of async requests; perhaps you
can explain how nontrivial apps will
be compellingly useful? 
but it's still not built in, who knows when it will be. The point is it's
not portable in either case.
Does that lack of portability imply it
isn't generally useful?  (When it was
apparent that TCP networks were useful,
berkeley sockets could be found even
on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)
Why would early Unix have run with the
idea that, if one wishes to do multiple
things at the same time, one can use a
group of processes to do them?
- they had Multics as a counterexample?
- in the days of tiny memories and tapes,
  people were more accustomed to writing
  programs that didn't run entirely in a
  single address space?
- one is a great number for an interface,
  as log(1) is 0, and specification can
  be implicit?
- some combination of the above?
Now, as Hoare says:
There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
As programmers, we've been able to make
our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.
Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.
Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police
with riot gear and pepper spray.

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and
arrested. Not very muddied at all.
What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the
word ""muddy"" to use it in a different context than the one
I posted.
Maybe the distinction I was trying to make was too subtle and
I was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning.

"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.
Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)
My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.
Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's
IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).
I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose

Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at
part of the equation.
America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is
a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There
is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the
right time, to go that high.
Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is
involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.
Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.
Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.
Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the
rest of us who tend to sort.
There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the
first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree
at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits
of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.
And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity
of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most
people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better
if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the
Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'
is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.
Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far
more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.
Superior performance, often not.

First, misattribution.  I did not write the blurb below.  I made one
statement about VP Cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.

I couldn't agree with you more on this: ""in short, then, economics is
not
a
zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the
backs
of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy
horseshit
is just that: horseshit, happy or otherwise,"" however, I resent being
lumped
in a zero-sum-zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that
rich
and
successful at face value is apropos of nothing and I am beginning to
understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad
hominem (re Cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like ""if rich
then
deservedly"" or ""if rich then smarter.""  Given that, I am also
beginning to
understand why some people NEED to be rich.

WRT to meritocracies - all hail, meritocracies!  WRT Harvard: over 90%
of
2002 graduates were cum laude +. INTERESTING curve.  Those eager to be
measured got their wish; those unwashed shy folk who just live it
provide
the balast.

Speaking of Forbes, was reading about Peter Norton just today in an
old
issue while waiting for my doctor.  Norton attributes his success to
LUCK.
Imagine.

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

Cheers,
RAH

Clearly you've never met ""Triumph"", the Fabulous Crotch-Sniffing
Caymanian Customs Wonder Dog at extreme close range, or heard the
story about the expat's college age kid, actually born on Cayman, who
was literally exiled from the island when the island constabulary
""discovered"" a marijuana seed or three in his summer-break rental car
a few years back.
I mean, his old man was some senior cheese at Global Crossing at the
time, but this was back when they could do no wrong. If that's what
they did to *his* kid, imagine what some poor former
junk-bond-hustler might have to deal with someday for, say, the odd
unauthorized Cuban nightlife excursion. A discretely folded twenty
keeps the stamp off your passport on the ground in Havana, and a
bottle of Maker's Mark goes a long way towards some interesting
nocturnal diversion when you get there and all, but still, you can't
help thinking that Uncle's going to come a-knockin', and that Cayman
van's going to stop rockin' some day, and when it does, it ain't
gonna be pretty.
Closer to home, conceptually at least, a couple of cryptogeeken were
hustled off and strip-searched, on the spot, when they landed on
Grand Cayman for the Financial Cryptography conference there a couple
of years ago. Like lots of cypherpunks, these guys were active
shooters in the Bay Area, and they had stopped in Jamaica, Mon, for a
few days on the way to Grand Cayman. Because they, and their stuff,
reeked on both counts, they were given complementary colorectal
examinations and an entertaining game of 20 questions, or two,
courtesy of the Caymanian Federales, after the obligatory fun and
games with a then-snarling Crotch-Sniffing Caymanian Wonder Dog.
Heck, I had to completely unpack *all* my stuff for a nice, well-fed
Caymanian customs lady just to get *out* of the country when I left.
Besides, tax havens are being increasingly constrained as to their
activities these days, because they cost the larger nation-states too
much in the way of ""escaped"" ""revenue"", or at least the perception of
same in the local ""free"" press. Obviously, if your money ""there""
isn't exchangeable into your money ""here"", it kind of defeats the
purpose of keeping your money ""there"" in the first place, giving
folks like FinCEN lots of leverage when financial treaties come up
for renegotiation due to changes in technology, like on-line
credit-card and securities clearing, or the odd governmental or
quango re-org, like they are wont to do increasingly in the EU, and
the US.
As a result, the veil of secrecy went in Switzerland quite a while
ago. The recent holocaust deposit thing was just the bride and groom
on that particular wedding-cake, and, as goes Switzerland, so goes
Luxembourg, and of course Lichtenstein, which itself is usually
accessible only through Switzerland. Finally, of course, the Caymans
themselves will cough up depositor lists whenever Uncle comes calling
about one thing or another on an increasingly longer list of fishing
pretexts.
At this point, the ""legal"", state-backed pecuniary privacy pickings
are kind of thin on the ground. I mean, I'm not sure I'd like to keep
my money in, say, Vanuatu. Would you? Remember, this is a place where
a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will
close it down until the local erst-cannibal hunter-gatherer turned
statutorily-permanent landowner figures out just what his new or
imagined property rights are this afternoon.
The point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only
solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private
transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent""
transactions currently are in meatspace. Then things get *real*
interesting, and financial privacy -- and considerably more personal
freedom -- will just be the icing on the wedding cake. Bride and
groom action figures sold separately, of course.
Cheers,
RAH
(Who went to FC2K at the Grand Cayman Marriott in February that year.
Nice place, I liked Anguilla better though, at least at the time, and
I haven't been back to either since. The beaches are certainly better
in Anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just
as porous as Cayman's is, by this point. If I were to pick up and
move Somewhere Free outside Your Friendly Neighborhood Unipolar
Superpower, New Zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and
Chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in
ballistic-missile flyover country. In that vein, who knows, maybe
we're in for some kind of latter-day Peloponnesian irony, and
*Russia* will end up the freest place on earth someday. Stranger
things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?)

Since the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). 
Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.

DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. 
*Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 
*Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 
Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 
*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.",0,0

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run

That would be fine, if I only understood how I should do that. I can't
find anything in the SA documention that mentions some kind of upper
limit for the size of a message. What should I put in my user_prefs
file?

I run SA from procmail btw, but I can't imagine that procmail would be
able to check the size of a message before handing it over to SA?
That's exactly what it can do:

CAREER SERVICES FROM LOCKERGNOME AND DICE.COM:
We've teamed up with
Dice.com to bring you a full service I.T. career enhancement solution.
Whether you are looking for your
dream job
or trying to
hire talented people
,
the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your
IT talent solution
today!
I've just got a few quick thoughts today.
First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.
Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, ""Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement."" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.
On to some Lockergnome news. If you haven't already heard,
CleverMedia
is sponsoring karaoke night at
Gnomedex
. According to the woman with her finger on the pulse of Gnomedex, Lori Lockwood, ""There is definitely a 'surprise' in the works for the attendees ... "" Hmmm. Could it even compare to last year's Miss Gnomedex contest? I think it unlikely. In any regard, the folks at CleverMedia are certainly more than capable of coming up with loads of fun -- it's what they do for a living! Between

Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II
I don't want to mince any words, here.
CodeWeavers
has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released
CrossOver Office
product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the
Wine Project
. Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.
Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and
CrossOver Plugin
(as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.
I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office ""fakes"" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.
Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.
For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a ""Wine Postscript Printer"" driver.
Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.
A note on the ""for pay"" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the ""free"" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.

GnomeCORE
Kernel Configuration - Part X
Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.
There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, ""Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?"" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.
See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.
Tomorrow, we
will
dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration.

Subject: RE: The Curse of India's Socialism



When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.
Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.
Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.
=========
I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.
> Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.

On the ""to find"" list.  Any chance of
an explanation of that ""Bell Jar"" in
the meantime?
French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)
==>
The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
 
--------------
De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.
[1] Actual poor people, not 'poor' Americans with a living standard that
is the envy of most of the world.

"I am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.
I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.
My questions are:
1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?
2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the <Virtual . . .> section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.
3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?
Thanks in advance for your help.

Defrosting the past
Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty
of a warming world
BY ALEX MARKELS
As he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed
Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000
feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and
amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't
live this high up.' ""
Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
bison–one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary
discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it
could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's
probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""
And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and
snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru
to Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
industry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As
the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is
emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky
fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our
predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.
""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through
studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude
archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic
Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice
Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have
offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as
the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional
treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.
Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother
Nature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can
deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're
often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
don't even realize they're ancient.
That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a
dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""
recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked
closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""
Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur
trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc
bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed
the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what
seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter
lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago
Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who
may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human
from the period ever found in North America.
Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could
explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the
first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people
living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we
see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""
Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek
caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,
Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south
Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been
caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a
wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.
Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a
pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a
4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the
ice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer
cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800
years of changing hunting practices.
Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.
Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded
some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts
up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research
project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing
darts.""
Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They
are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell
and St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States' most glaciated
terrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing
European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as
the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude
archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're
probably about the only ones happy about it.""",0,0

"Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.
We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);
the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were:

        0.187
        0.749
        0.780

    false negative percentages
        2.072
        2.448
        0.574
    total unique fn 43
The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run
fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.
Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about
600 ham and spam in each:
    false positive percentages
        0.000
        1.398
        1.398
        0.000

        5.206
        5.027
        9.874
    total unique fn 970
So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported
significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
those starting with 'x-vm').
When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I
see:
    false positive percentages
        0.000
        0.000
        0.200
        0.000

    total unique fp 10
    false negative percentages

        0.400
        0.200
        0.600

        1.200

        0.400

        0.400
        0.000
        0.600
    total unique fn 36
This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.
It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.",0,0

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.
also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says ""converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW"".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)
don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, ""the more the merrier"". ;-)
You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.
AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.
Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too

circulation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was
exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.
I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada
had much effect.  And Canada is still a prosperous country.

China?  Ooops, no wait, scratch that.

There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be
precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited
England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben
explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar,
and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The
British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to
clamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were
rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.

According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political
party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about
tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were
protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces
that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes
they were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada
was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the
late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the
juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.

I've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse
of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of
other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when
we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>
*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*
A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.
The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.
Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.
If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.
Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.
Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.
""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""
Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""
Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.
""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.
Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.
Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.
Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""
""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.
A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""
Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca

"Hello all,
Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I
downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
make
At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
make: *** [w3] Error 2
When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
the commands I used.
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
followed by the commands make and make install.
There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.
Thanks again

speaking of that IDE (weblogic developer) the open source version called
eclipse is free from eclipse.org If you are doing java development you
need to get this IDE . I've been using it for the last month and it is
absolutly superb. Best thing about it is that rather than using swing
(which is crap) is that they have their own native widget set called swt.
When you run it on windows it uses windows widgets but when you run it on

BTW, if you use exmhwrapper (found in the misc directory), you can generalize 
this to

DISPLAY=`cat $HOME/.exmh/.display` artsplay <soundfile>
Yes, but that probably means that you have to have exmh

With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the

    I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of

    I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two

    husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our 
    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider 
    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic 
    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank 
    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds 
    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my 
    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the 
    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and 
    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code",0,0

"Hi,
In my build scripts, I have problems with some of the kernel packages.
For kernel-sources, I get :
Package kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
on running apt-get install kernel-source
Now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
Second, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is 
done from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.
Thanks,
Thomas

For the francophones among you, this article is a summary of the
reasons why most free software licences (and the GPL in
particular) are not valid in France.
http://www.linuxfrench.net/article.php3?id_article=1043
Google translation (hard to read most of the time, but good
enough to pick up the gist)
http://makeashorterlink.com/?U26B52602
In brief, in an international contract, when mentioning copyright,  you
must mention under which jurisdiction's laws the copyright
is applied. French law requires the licence to be available in
French (the GPL isn't). And French law requires that for a
contract to be valid, it must not breach existing law. Also under
French law, the copyright holder automatically retains the right
to change the licence, which means that French law is in conflict
with the GPL, which requires authorisation from all authors
before a licence change is allowed.
Also there's some stuff about French consumer law forbidding sale
without guarantee of anything, so software delivered as-is
breaches consumer law in France. But I didn't really follow that.
My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered ""with all faults"", so
at least they are honest).

"I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.
I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)
At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?
Any ideas would be welcome.
Thanks,
Joe

"Thanks Matthias.  Actually I got all four speakers with subwoofer

However switching between analog and digital, I'm still baffled.  As I
have a tuner and cassette deck hooked up to ""Line In"" on a SBLive! 5.1,
which is in analog mode.  But digital out works great now!

Maybe you could find more info or tips on the ALSA page for your card?
Also, you could try ""alsactl store"", editing /etc/asound.state"" by hand
(for me it contains data similar to what I can control with ""alsamixer"")
then run ""alsactl restore"" and see if you're able to change what you want
that way.

Date: 2002-09-23T16:11:02-05:00
Trust me when I tell you that heavy medication and RDF do not mix. Here is a 
list of things I intend to re-read once the fog lifts: 
- _Phil Ringnalda_: Using FOAF relationships[1] and Just say no to Trackback in 
index.html[2]. 
- _Les Orchard_: Per-post comment RSS feed[3]. 
- _Phil Wainewright_: The bare necessities of RSS[4] and What to do about RDF
[5]. The beginning of an RSS 2.0 best practices document. 
- _Jonathon Delacour_: Trying to score a goal[6]. &#8220;As the best and the 
brightest focus on the possibilities of FOAF, I turned my attention to 
yesterday's news: RSS.&#8221; No, RSS will always be today's news. Get it? 
Today's newzzz... Never mind. 
- Comments on Ben Hammersley's Friend of a Friend[7]. Various ways to link to a 
FOAF file from an RSS feed. 
- _Nicholas Chase_: The Web's future: XHTML 2.0[8]. We're losing backward 
compatibility, isn't that great? Well, he seems to think so. 
- mod_cc[9], a module for including copyright information in RDF documents such 
as RSS 1.0 feeds, and, I hope, FOAF files. 
- _Shelley Powers_: Who is your audience, and what are you trying to 
accomplish?[10] Addressing the growing identity crisis on the RSS-DEV mailing 
list[11]. Also the comments on Shelley's article[12]. 
- _Ian Hickson_: Pingback 1.0[13]. &#8220;The best thing about this idea is 
that unlike similar schemes like TrackBack, it is totally transparent to both 
users.&#8221; 
- New software helps in building of accessible web sites[14]. A press release 
for a new edition of LIFT[15], which I have never used. 
- Forget Mars bars, Twinkies now the deep-fried treat[16]. &#8220;The secret to 
making a deep-fried Twinkie, he says, is to place it in the fridge first to 
give it more stability. He then rolls it in flour, covers it with batter ... 
and plunks it into the oil.&#8221;

"[Barry A. Warsaw, gives answers and asks questions]
Here's the code that produced the header tokens:
    x2n = {}
    for x in msg.keys():
        x2n[x] = x2n.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in x2n.items():
        yield ""header:%s:%d"" % x
Some responses:
 0.01    19  3559 'header:X-Mailman-Version:1'
 0.01    19  3559 'header:List-Id:1'
 0.01    19  3557 'header:X-BeenThere:1'
These three are definitely MM artifacts, although the second one
/could/ be inserted by other list management software (it's described
in an RFC).
Since all the ham came from Mailman, and only 19 spam had it, it's quite
safe to assume then that I should ignore these for now.
 0.01     0  3093 'header:Newsgroups:1'
 0.01     0  3054 'header:Xref:1'
 0.01     0  3053 'header:Path:1'
These aren't MM artifacts, but are byproducts of gating a message off
of an nntp feed.  Some of the other NNTP-* headers are similar, but I
won't point them out below.
I should ignore these too then.
 0.01    19  2668 'header:List-Unsubscribe:1'
 0.01    19  2668 'header:List-Subscribe:1'
 0.01    19  2668 'header:List-Post:1'
 0.01    19  2668 'header:List-Help:1'
 0.01    19  2668 'header:List-Archive:1'
RFC recommended generic listserve headers that MM injects.
Ditto.
So why do you get two entries for this one?
 0.99   519     0 'header:Received:8'
 0.99   466     1 'header:Received:7'
Read the code <wink>.  The first line counts msgs that had 8 instances of a
'Received' header, and the second counts msgs that had 7 instances.  I
expect this is a good clue!  The more indirect the mail path, the more of
those thingies we'll see, and if you're posting from a spam trailer park in
Tasmania you may well need to travel thru more machines.
...
Note that header names are case insensitive, so this one's no
different than ""MIME-Version:"".  Similarly other headers in your list.
Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide.
It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing
package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigures his package.
 0.02    65  3559 'header:Precedence:1'
Could be Mailman, or not.  This header is supposed to tell other
automated software that this message was automated.  E.g. a replybot
should ignore any message with a Precedence: {bulk|junk|list}.
Rule of thumb:  if Mailman inserts a thing, I should ignore it.  Or, better,
I should stop trying to out-think the flaws in the test data and get better
test data instead!
 0.50     4     0 'header:2:1'
!?
...
 0.50     0     2 'header:'
Heh?
I sucked out all the wordinfo keys that began with ""header:"".  The last line
there  was probably due to unrelated instances of the string ""header:"" in
message bodies.  Harder to guess about the first line.
...
Some headers of course are totally unreliable as to their origin.  I'm
thinking stuff like MIME-Version, Content-Type, To, From, etc, etc.
Everyone sticks those in.
The brilliance of Anthony's ""just count them"" scheme is that it requires no
thought, so can't be fooled <wink>.  Header lines that are evenly
distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators
(prob near 0.5), so do no harm.",0,0

"The hunting community showing, yet again, how utterly out of touch they 
are....(though the anti-Esso sign on the Long Man made me smirk last week)
From: ""Carol""
The white horses at Uffington and Kilburn have had hunters painted

Ananova:
Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'
Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.
Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers"".
Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.
In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.
But no-one reported anything to the police.
A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.
In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.
Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

"[Anthony Baxter]
I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different
ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.
As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about
credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and
asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots
of ""commercial"" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty
badly wrong.
Can this corpus be shared?  I suppose not.
I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever
else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers
(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of (header,
count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the
X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.
If we ever <wink> have a shared corpus, an easy refactoring of timtest
should allow to plug in different tokenizers.  I've only made three changes
to Graham's algorithm so far (well, I've made dozens -- only three survived
testing as proven winners), all the rest has been refining the tokenization
to provide better clues.
I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
rates to drop.
That's ambiguous.  Accuracy rates or error rates, ham or spam rates?
I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="""" and src="""" - there's
so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
the attributes).
Mining embedded http/https/ftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half
in my tests (not keying off href, just scanning for anything that ""looked
like"" one); that was the single biggest f-n improvement I've seen.  It
didn't change the false positive rate.  So you know whether src added
additional power, or did you do both at once?",0,0

THE ISO17799 NEWSLETTER - EDITION 4
______________________________________________________
Welcome to the fourth edition of the ISO17799 newsletter, designed to

subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues, plus
commentary on recent Information Security incidents. 
Guidance and information included in this issue:
1)  The ISO17799 Toolkit Uncovered 
2)  Social Engineering - Are you Susceptible?
3)  ISO17799: A World Wide Phenomena
4)  Stranger Danger

10)  Subscription Information
THE ISO17799 TOOLKIT UNCOVERED
==============
The ISO17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of
an introductory pack appropriately called 'The ISO17799 Toolkit'. But
why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack?  
The purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying
start with respect to ISO17799... not only to understand the standard
itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more
quickly.
The contents can be broken down into two groups: those that help the
organization to understand where ISO17799 fits and what is involved in
embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first
critical steps to compliance.
In the former group are the 'RoadMap to Certification' (which broadly
describes the process of gaining certification), the 'XL Management
Presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status
of the standard) and of course the ISO17799 standard itself (both
parts).
In the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. These include
a comprehensive set of ISO17799 compliant security policies to address
section 3 (Security Policy) and business continuity audit checklists to
help address section 11 (Business Continuity Management).
It doesn't end there, however. For the audit section there is a detailed
set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. For
newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary
of terms.  
Clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. However,
in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of
ISO17799, it can be invaluable. 
More information on the ISO17799 Toolkit and how to purchase can be
found at: http://www.iso17799-made-easy.com
The standard itself can alternatively be procured from:  
http://www.iso17799.net 
SOCIAL ENGINEERING - ARE YOU SUSCEPTIBLE?
===================The term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually
based around the concept of genetic tampering. However, when applied to
IT security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary.
Following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches
has been produced. These are designed to gather information without the
target even realizing that they have parted with it.
The attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations
for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. The telephone
is probably the major source of pre-meditated acts.  
The following are some of the major techniques employed:
BAITING
This essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some
leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. Often, items of
conversation are introduced based upon replies received. The fiction is
legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places.
PULLING RANK
This amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the
company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. It does
not necessitate direct impersonation... only the POSITION needs to be
assumed. 
EXHAUSTING
This involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down
the target.
SURF BOARDING
Basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something
confidential. This could be directly, through a window, through a
doorway, etc.
SURVEYS
The information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to
a criminal. The surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate
purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. In either case
sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed.
There are of course many other techniques. However, disclosure can be
prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. 
Before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish:
a) the sensitivity of the information
b) your authority to exchange or release the information
c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication)
d) the purpose of the exchange
The act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes.
ISO17799 - A WORLD WIDE PHENOMINA ===============Disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global
take on of ISO17799 proves that organizations the planet over are
embracing it with enthusiasm.
To illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a
table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the ISO17799
Electronic Shop (www.iso17799.net). The figures below do come with a
serious health warning though - the Electronic Shop is a credit card
purchase system. Some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as
others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase
position significantly understated. An example is India, which acquires
substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last
500 from the download location.
That aside, the table makes interesting reading:

STRANGER DANGER
======As you read this article, look around at your working environment. The
items/information you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because
you deal with them every day... but now look again.
If you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them?
What would you find if you looked around? Picture yourself as a visitor
passing through. What can you hear in terms of conversation? What can
you see?
The chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not
want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. If this is the case,
the security of your information is at risk potentially from every
visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. 
This article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors,
but nonetheless, it is important to be fully AWARE of what CAN happen if
due caution is not exercised.
The following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are
minimized:
* Your reception/visitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure
that visitors wear them
* Consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.
* Challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges
* If your location issues identity badges - make sure YOU wear yours
* Do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they
are doing
* Do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)...
don't let them make their way to you
* Do not hold doors open for people not displaying their ID
* Do not leave visitors alone   
ISO17799 - MORE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
====================
1) How many controls are there in the standard?
Part 1 is organized into 10 sections. There are 127 main controls and
over 500 detailed controls in total.
2) What is part 2?
Part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to
build and operate an information security management system.
3) How old is it?
The standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the DTI in
the UK. It became BS7799 in 1995 and of course ISO17799 in 2000.
4) What is accreditation?
An accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties
under the standard (p2). A number of accreditation bodies exist in
different countries.
5) Is certification for life?
No. It is normally for three year periods.
6) ISO17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally
created? Yes indeed. The latest versions included input from
representatives from many nations, including Australia, Brazil, Germany,
Norway, UK and USA, amongst others.
7) Is it linked to a specific national legal system?
No. It is generic in terms of legislation.
CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS: MINIMIZE THE RISKS
=====================
The use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has
become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are
associated information security risks which we should pause to consider,
especially when making payments over the Internet.  
Web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods
and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber
criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods,
which can then be easily exchanged for cash.  There are also relatively
simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers
to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time,
from millions of people. A survey by the IT research company Gartner
(http://www.gartner.com) predicted that Internet crime involving the
""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this
year.  
We recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the
risks involved in credit card transactions:
* Ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the
Internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they
have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific Internet
purchases.
* All expenses incurred through Internet transactions should be
carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.
* Only enter credit card details on a Web site if you are confident as
to its authenticity and that the connection is secure - the prefix https
(as opposed to the usual http) in the Web Site address indicates a
secure connection.
* If the security of a Web site is in doubt, any confidential
information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent.  Be
extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where
the Internet Service Provider hosting the site is not verified. Note
that we have pre-checked all sites referenced in this newsletter for
security!
* If ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are
talking to the correct person.  If you are unsure whether the
organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively,
pay by some other means.
* Lost or stolen credit card details may be used for Internet
transactions.  Inform the card issuer and relevant person within your
organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen.

ISO17799 SECTION 11: BCP REVIEW 
==============Business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a
core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business
continuity plan.
Creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course.
This is one reason why software products were produced. Unfortunately
these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn,
expensive, etc.
Recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with
organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex
task. At the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in
MS-Word: The BCP Generator.
This was designed from top down to simplify business continuity
planning. It comprises two components: a plan template and an
interactive guide (the latter using Word macros to jump to and fro into
the correct part of the template). It's impact upon the business
continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very
largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. It is in
active use in over 40 countries.
  
With this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market,
there is now NO excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. The old
lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than
they ever were. Although section 11 is very clear with respect to the
need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due
diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one.
For information on the BCP Generator see: 
http://www.disaster-recovery-plan.com
For information on business continuity generally, see:

IT COULDN'T HAPPEN HERE....COULD IT?
=================
Every issue of The ISO17799 Newsletter features at least one TRUE story
of an information security breach and its consequences. Again, in this
issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents:
1) On 25th October a contract programmer who had once worked for a large
US based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the
security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). In the
dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and
interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run - noting down
security codes as they were entered. He then left and hung around
outside until just after normal trading time.
He then rang the Bank from a public phone box and initiated an
electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a Swiss account. 
The plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes
incorrectly, but he rang the Bank department back and incredibly managed
to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit.
He flew to Switzerland and later returned with the money. He was caught
simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. When
the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their
loss!
2) Remote, or dial-in access can be a real Achilles heel if not properly
controlled. In a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major
company's system by using the default password of a system engineer
(which had never been changed!). 
This gave him considerable scope and powers of access. To cover for
himself, however, he semi-disabled the machine log, changed a number of
user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered
with the dial back system.
Getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another
computer and ended up making it crash. All this took place over a couple
of evenings.
To recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime
computer and restore from the previous weeks back-up, at considerable
cost.
3) Over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions
within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to
critical levels. The impact was such that the business fell behind with
its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third
parties. As it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it
started to lose the confidence of its customers. The situation began to
spiral. 
Eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called
the police. Secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor
staff. One was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units
and also attaching paper clips to them. Both these actions led to a
short circuit.
When confronted, he confessed everything. His motive was to earn
overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was
delayed by the malfunction. He netted 689 UKP over the 9 months. The
company lost at least 500,000 UKP.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm
Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 
They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 
 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 
Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 
Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 
""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 
Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 
The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 
But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 
In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 
Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 
The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 
A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 
Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Think about it!
Just as you have a web designer to build your site and a company to host your site,does it not make sense to use a company that specializes in professionally submitting your web site. 
Getting your web site FOUND and SEEN!
 A Shocking Fact!
Your web site designer and your host are NOT responsible for getting your web site seen!  Yes, they may submit your site to a few search engines periodically but to stay on the TOP of the search engines is an aggressive business.
Getting onto the search engines and at the top of their listings doesn't  just happen.
You have to be put there!
What the.Net, The Internet Magazine 8/2000 said:
""You have your web site designed and have sorted out the maintenance and waiting for the business to roll in, but there's one small problem.... No one knows!""
You need a professional company to do it!
Your Money Back

 thereafter for the next year.
The results will astound you!
Most of your competition are unaware of the facts below!
This is to YOUR Advantage!
Web Site Facts
Remember ""The Yellow Pages"" Rule! 
 A search engine is like an enormous ""yellow pages"" with thousands of companies advertising the same product.  Unless you are near the front of the listing your chances of a customer actually seeing you is remote.  Unlike a literal yellow pages there is a way to move YOU to the front and also get you on all of the ""Yellow pages"" in the world.
What does it take to be seen on the 
Search Engines?
Appreciate the Three Golden Rules
q Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! 
q Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on).
q Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! 
Use the right ones and you go up.
Get it wrong and you go to the bottom!
Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. 
Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried.  Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them.  Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. 
It is essential to be on them!
Having Regal Telecom expertly submit your web site every month to worlds search engines will give YOU the Advantage you need. 
 This can make the difference between new customers 
FINDING your web site or NOT!

I actually thought of this kind of active chat at AOL (in 1996 I think), 
bringing up ads based on what was being discussed and other features.  For 
a while, the VP of dev. (now still CTO I think) was really hot on the idea 
and they discussed patenting it.  Then they lost interest.  Probably a

Dear sirs or Madams,
We are one Arcyl bathtub manufacturer in China.
-----------------Profile-----------------------
Our factoryspecializes in manufacturing YEMA brand acrylic composite bathtubs, we have more than 10 years experience of bathtub manufacturing and marketing. With 
our considerable experience we set out to blend the advantages of all the other of bathtubs offered in the market place into one range. After several years 
development we produced our current range and the YEMA brand bathtub was patented in 2001. We were even awarded the ""Gold Medal"" in the ""Chinese Patent Technology 
Exhibition"" and ""The Ninth Chinese New Patent Technology and New Patent Product Exhibition"" later that year. The YEMA bathtubs structural design is that of a normal 
acrylic bathtub but conglutinated into a composite material. It is ridged and is made more than twice as thick as a normal unit, making it more smooth, gentle and 
elegant. This manufacturing technique not only provides all the advantages of a normal acrylic bathtub (easily to clean, resistance to dirt, colorful,attractive etc) 
but also provides increased heat retention, and extends the products life span.
Besides our products on website, we now produce some new models for USA market. We also produce shower panels with finest quality.

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes 
the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater 
performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the 
first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based 
startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data 
between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the 
file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach 
the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with 
regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that 
he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes 
of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 
1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large 
collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the 
markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and 
will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an 
application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators 
more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging 
market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega 
XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, 
launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at 
$54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=============================================================> ==========> 
DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs 
since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry 
interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was 
a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML 
processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own 
products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team 
raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built 
hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first 
versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing 
industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital 
Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital 
and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, 
of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, 
marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware 
networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and 
transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web 
services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed 
processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s 
critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of 
performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load 
balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology 
addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing 
the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. 
""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, 
DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for 
enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 
MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The

cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't
yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of
income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 
With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell
you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard

"ATTN:MANAGER
HELLO DEAR,
I am well confidence of your capability to assist me
in
a transaction for mutual benefit for both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish on you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.
Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
sell of
Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.
Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:
(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another nearby country where taxation will not
take great toll on the money?
(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?
(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
will be invested?
Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.
For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
business. The security of this business is very
important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential.
I shall expect your urgent reply.
My telephone number is 22507625348.
Thank you and God bless you
BELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348

In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX.
 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.
 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.
 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.
 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.
 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

'settle' driving away straights and other prior inhabitants with

Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how

"Dear Sir/Ma, 
I am HAJIYA MARYAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State,General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project. The Russian Partners returned my husband's share of USD$35,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3!
 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within. Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can check it through their website : www.thisdayonline.com , click on archives,8th. june, 2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l proposed a percentage of 3!
 0% of the total sum to you for the expected service and assistance, 10
% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address above. l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while await your prompt response. NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l have decided that this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy, remember to include your private Telephone or fax number for easy communication. You can also contact my trusted friend and family attorney,Barrister Aishat Gidado at aishatgidado@go.com or her number 248033044180.
Best Regards. 
Hajia Maryam Abacha.

"As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.
If a user has a line like:
whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.com
in his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
to be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger SA.
Thanks in advance for any help.

IM client vulnerable to attack 
IM client vulnerable to attack 
James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  
Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.
Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.
Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.
According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.
David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.
""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it.""
He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece.""
""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.
Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.

Hi,
Want to increase your chances of winning a big jackpot in those
            Internet contests?
Michael Khalili, the famous programmer who you may have read about
            in USA Today and other newspapers, came up with a method that makes
            it
hundreds of times easier to win online.
He recently wrote a program that will AUTOMATICALLY enter you in
            online contests--over and over UNTIL YOU WIN (or tell it to stop).
            We at Grab.com are so excited by this system that we're putting it
            online for our members to use.
THE PRIZE IS YOURS - GUARANTEED!
If you win a contest using this program, the prize is legally yours
            to keep--GUARANTEED! Our lawyers assured us that Michael's program
            is legal, and online contest sponsors have CONFIRMED that it doesn't
            violate their rules.
So if you win a prize, you'll receive it.
            If you don't receive it, we'll pay you ourselves. GUARANTEED.
FREE TO USE.
Best of all, this service is free to use. All you pay for is related
            network expenses--which only cost $1 for 7 days of the service.
            That's dozens of entries for what you'd usually pay to get a single
            lottery ticket!
As a member in good standing of this mailing,
we've already
            set up the automatic entry system for you.
All that's left
            is for you to turn it on. Once you do, you can sit back and watch it
            enter you into contest after contest after contest after contest....
Click
            here to begin!
P.S. This system will continue to enter you into hundreds of free
            contests until you win (or cancel it).
P.P.S. All the prizes you win are yours to keep--GUARANTEED!

The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.
Nice to hear that somebody else does this too.

but a dialup connection will work just fine.
The type of email lists you use may also affect the software's
performance.
Single domain lists will mail faster than a mixed domain email list.
A smaller message puts less strain on the mail servers,
therefore, smaller messages mean faster delivery.
A small text or html message is all you need,
to get your customers attention.
An eye catching subject line is also very important.
BonFire will send either html or text messages.
You can also control the BCC count.
Just check a few boxes and send yourself some messages as a test..
You'll see for yourself the great value of the BonFire mailer.

Symphony Telecom (OTCBB: SYPY) went UP 100% in just one week!!!
InDigiNet Identifies 
Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35 Million...
Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate
T
he Wall Street Bulletin believes 
that the
recent 
investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett
, 
is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication 
market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized 
enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some 
carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, 
the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry 
that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems 
mean opportunity. ""Every major industry in the history of 
the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from 
the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s 
to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says
Robert 
Saunders
, director of the Eastern Management Group market 
research firm.
Christopher 
Dean
, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all 
the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money 
and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used 
to cost a few billion for a few millions.""
Read the full 
story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end 
of this newsletter.
As we write this report, our New Recommendation 
InDigiNet, Inc. (
OTCBB: 
IGTT
) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since 
late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its 
business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way 
up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our 
strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest 
Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH.
Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous 
Growth Potential
We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not 
greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, 
Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK),
share 
price began to explode in April of this year moving from just 
over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June
. Talk America 
Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but 
today has a market cap of $267 million.
IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. 
Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well 
be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market 
cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. 
So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right 
 for investors to get in on the ground floor.
The
InDigNet
Strategy
InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company 
that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated 
communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious
""Diamond"" 
level partner of Avaya
, as well as a reseller for Cisco and 
Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and 
wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the 
Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the 
capital burden of building a communication network. The Company’s 
strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market 
communication companies and attractively priced
Internet 
Service Providers
(ISPs).
The Company recently completed 
its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect
. 
InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow 
revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion 
in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, 
or 33% of the country’s total market, and this spending 
is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years.

The IGTT web site:
www.indiginet.com
The
IT Market
Based on recent studies, the country’s 7.4 
million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of
IT
and data 
communications, including Internet access, web services, business 
software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 
billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 
2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher 
IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, 
growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for 
the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 
2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 
3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth 
of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent 
in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat 
growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will 
return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown 
in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa 
and Poland.

IDC
Particulars
The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our 
Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following 
reasons:
1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer 
bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively 
priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell 
its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that 
will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all 
types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, 
and data.
2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front 
Range communities but in particular the education vertical market 
has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data 
network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers 
include
United States Olympic Committee
(USOC),
University of Denver
, 
and
Colorado State University
.
3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues 
to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy 
court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer 
bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's 
footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the 
Company's embedded customer base.
Investment Consideration
InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the 
three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 
in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth 
rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first 
year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more 
and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors 
will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment 
dollars.

Dear readers,
It was a crushing blow to discover that
Vindigo
, my
all-time-favorite Palm app, was no longer free. Twenty-five bucks
wasn't steep, but the principle of paying for a former freebie
was hard to swallow. Not that hard, though; surprising
myself--and my fellow cheapskates--I've discovered that I'd
rather dish out the dough than go Vindigo-free myself.
That's what Web-based e-mail providers are banking on. Now that
most of us have gotten sucked in by those gratis Web e-mail
accounts, most ""free"" Web e-mailers have started charging for
premium services or imposing strict limitations on free accounts.

WorldCom woes continue
WorldCom woes dominate, BearShare 4.0 isn't what it used to be,
and Jaguar runs ahead of schedule.
--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
WorldCom
:
I hate to put it first, but unfortunately, all other
   tech trends are overshadowed by this scandal. Now entering its
   fourth week as front-page news, WorldCom woes continue to sap
   investor confidence. This week's big story: the top execs from
   the company are standing silent against government accusations
   of wrongdoing.
2
BearShare 4.0
:
This new version of the well-known peer-to-peer
   software was been completely redesigned and comes in two
   flavors: free with ads and paid without ads. This is nice
   touch, but unfortunately, 4.0 fails in one key area:
   downloading music. It uses the Gnutella client, but in CNET's
   tests, it had an abysmal success rate at actually returning
   files.
3
Jaguar
:
Who ever heard of an operating system release being
   early? Well, Apple is managing to pull off the impossible; it
   intends to ship an update to OS X in August, instead of the
   anticipated late fall time frame.
4
Warcraft III
:
Ah, summer: the perfect time to stay inside and
   sit in front of your computer. Warcraft III has just been
   released--right in time for the good weather. GameSpot calls
   it one the finest games ever made, but if that doesn't do it
   for you, there's another fighting game on deck (see No. 5).
5
America's Army
:
As Senior Editor Darren Gladstone pointed out in a recent column, the Army wants
you
to play PC games.
   That's right: the United States Army spent $6.3 million
   developing its own title, and it has just launched a television
   campaign to drum up interest. Apparently, the campaign is
   working, since CNET users made America's Army a top search
   term last week.

 RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,

"Gooday,
With warm heart my friend, I send you my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. 
It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity. I have kept it to myself for a long time, and now I need to act, as time is not on my side. I want you to open-heartedly read through and give me your most needed support. I got your address from an internet directory, in my search for a contact. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance. 
My name is Donald Phiri, the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr. David Stevens, a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke, Zimbabwe. My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on 15 of April 2001, due to the land dispute and political situation in my country, as a result of my master's financial support for the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), the main opposition party to President Mugabe's party,  Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) . For more information on my master's murder, you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year 2001.
When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers, my master forsaw the danger ahead, he then closed his major bank accounts, and together, we went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of $14.5 million (Fourten million, five hundred thousand USdollars), in a private security company, for safety. This money was deposited in a box in my name, as my master was being secretive with his name, as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe's actions. The box is labeled as gemstones. My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana. He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe. My master is divorced, and his wife Valerie, and only child, Diana have relocated to Bradford, !
 En!
gland for 9years now. 
I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. I have now decided to transfer my  master's  money into an account for security and safety reasons. This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left. You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you.
If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands, and then we will transfer the money into an account. You may open a new account for this purpose. I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here, which they have done. 
To legally process the claim of the box, I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative, and deliver the box to you. I have with me, the certificate used to deposit the box, which we will need for claiming the box. 
For valuable assistance, I am offering you 10%($1,450,000) of the total money. I have also set aside 1%($145,000) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%($580,000), will be given to Charity in my master's name I will give 25% ($3,625,000) to Valerie and Diana, after my share of the money has been transfered back to me. When they grant my asylum application, my share of the money (85%), will be transfered back to me, into an account I will solely own. I also intend to start up a business then. If you have knowledge of farming business in your country, or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in, please inform me, so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being.
Please, I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction. 
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you.
Yours sincerely,
Donald Phiri.

Could you double check what ""apt-get update"" does? And eventually post
the
output if there are any errors or messages you don't understand.
OK, I did it again, and here's what I got:

So, it looks like it worked, and the files are updated..  very strange.  
Maybe something went wrong updating apt from my old version (as used
with rh7.2), and this one.  Lemme try totally uninstalling and
reinstalling it..

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi
Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Apple's iPod comes to Linux
Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

Microsoft eyes Visa users with Passport
Microsoft hopes to extend its Passport online identification system into authorizing credit card payments.
The software giant will strike a partnership Tuesday with security-software maker Arcot Systems, which builds online payment systems for merchants and for banks that issue Visa and MasterCard credit cards.

Judge OKs suit against Kazaa parent
A federal judge said Monday that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) sued three prominent file-swapping companies in October in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm
chai.
Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.
Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.
Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )
So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.
The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose
tot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking
of ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far
form set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.
Also any portlanders.....party time.

Smallest files are listed first with the largest at the end. So if

3. BE A SF.NET FOUNDRY GUIDE.
4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
5. SITE STATISTICS
0. INTRO
Hello SourceForge.net Users,
This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.
Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:
http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html
How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.
Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.
If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.
Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.
Pat-
Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net
1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY
SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.
Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:
Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
http://www.twtelecom.com/
University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
http://www.umn.edu/
CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/
We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
the needs of the Open Source community.
On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net
2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE
SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX
Kernel Summit, held in June.  Listen to the Linux kernel master
discuss such hot topics as kernel modules, virtual memory,
block I/O, database scaling, security modules, and async I/O.
You may find this audio repository at:
http://linuxkernel.foundries.sourceforge.net/article.pl?sid=02/06/26/0116225
3. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE!
Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to
code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool
projects that they think are worth downloading and testing.
A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of
choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a
foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
topic that interests you; and send email to
foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
are qualified to be a foundry guide.
4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
We have a new position for a senior web developer available at
SourceForge.net.  We are looking for someone to help us maintain,
upgrade, and add new features to SourceForge.net.  Ideal person has
5+ years of development experience on high end, high volume

replies that look like this:  ""Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful

there was a check box that said ""Receive Site-wide updates, low

hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6

Wow. Check out Western Digital's Drivezilla. They've announced 200GB hard 
disks. Something tells me that I'll have my own terabyte by the end of 2003....",0,0
"Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.
The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.
But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.
SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.
Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.
So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.
All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?
Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.
* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.
Ricco is nota  Paul Bearer or a Jimmy Heart at all but more like a buddy
who goes to the ring with them and occasional interferes..ugh.",0,0

Looks like a problem with the avifile you've rebuilt... I've been unable to
recompile successfully the latest version on 8.0 :-/
Hm, it is built inside the same chroot.  aviplay works (well it would if I 
had XV, I get X errors ;)).  But it doesn't complain about linker 
problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok.
Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects - 
naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of 
libraries, API stability, ...

"Hi,
some time now the following messages were haunting me:
     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude
It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.
# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...
I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others at the O'Reilly OS X con have tracked 
down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network here -- every 
20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages from your 
browser and other net-utilities. 
It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 
So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Don't do the

Hi, My name is Daniel and I have been involved in Internet 
                        Marketing since its inception. E-marketing provides individuals 
                        and businesses with a low cost solution for broad-based 
                        advertising
If you are new to this concept do not fret! I was too! 
                        It took me over 2 years of research by scowering the Internet, 
                        dealing with false claims, hassling with the (so-called) 
                        ""bulk-mail specialists"" experiencing the trials 
                        and errors ""bogus"" software programs and false 
                        claims they make, to truly understand the ins & outs 
                        of marketing concepts and principles of email marketing.
These 
                          processes are time consuming, resource intensive, frustrating 
                          and potentially expensive for individuals and companies 
                          to do on their own.
Let's 
                          face it! Most people in business want to make money! 
                          Their time is consumed by running their business, developing 
                          marketing campaigns and advertisement, cashing checks, 
                          dealing with customers, managing their staff and so 
                          on!
They 
                          don't have time to invest in learning 10 or 15 different 
                          software applications, learn how to effectively port 
                          scan for IPS, Socks and SMTP relays, spend thousands

Have a BLAST in bed,
GUARANTEED!
Finally, a safe and natural penile enlargement
supplement!
Naturally boost your sex drive and rejuvenate sexual
function.
Good news, men! Recent
discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!
Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements:
Maxaman™.
Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxaman™ can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxaman™
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.
A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.
What To
Expect:
1-2 weeks
Most men notice more powerful and longer lasting erections almost
immediately. A noticeable increase in thickness is also
common.
3-8 weeks
By this point you should be able to notice an increase in
thickness in both erect and flaccid states, as well as an overall
increase in length.
9 weeks +
After nine weeks, your penis should be noticeably larger in both
length and girth.
Below is a comparison chart compiled from the most recent
data on penis size. See how you measure up...
How to measure your penis size
correctly:
To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.
Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
without resorting to dangerous surgery or cumbersome
weights.
The
all-natural proprietary blend of unique herbs found in Maxaman is
designed to restore blood flow, unleash stored testosterone, and
heighten sensation by activating the body's natural hormone
production and supplying vital nutrients necessary for peak sexual
performance. All of the ingredients in Maxaman are stringently
scrutinized, and are guaranteed to be of the highest pharmaceutical
grade.

Maxaman is not
a pharmaceutical drug and contains none of the synthetic chemicals
found in prescription medications. It is an all natural formula
designed to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding the
sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains in
both length and thickness. Maxaman provides men with a safe and
natural alternative to potentially dangerous
surgery.
9. How
long will it take to get my order?
Shipped the same day payment is received in most
cases..
10. Is it really safe to order
online?
Absolutely!
All information about your order is encrypted, and cannot be viewed
by anyone else. Ordering online using this state-of-the-art
processing system is actually much safer than using your credit
card in a restaurant or at the mall.
11. Is
Maxaman shipped discreetly?
Yes it is!
Maxaman is sent in an unmarked box with no indication whatsoever as
to what is contained inside.
11. How
much is shipping and handling?
$6.95
for the 1st. bottle
and free for any
order more than 1 bottle.
The special
blend of herbs in
Maxaman
™ have been shown to boost
blood flow to the penis, thus expanding the sponge-like erectile
tissue in the penis, leading to size gains in both length and
thickness.
The proprietary blend of herbs
found in Maxaman™ consists of:
Zinc (as zinc oxide)
- This essential mineral is required for
protein synthesis and collagen formation. Sufficient intake and
absorption of zinc are needed to maintain a proper concentration of
Vitamin E.
Yohimbe
- Used traditionally to treat impotence and frigidity,
Yohimbe helps to increase blood flow and sensitivity of nerves,
especially in the pelvic region. It is commonly used as an
aphrodisiac to stimulate sexual organs and improve central nervous
system function.
Maca -
Maca is an adaptogen. It works to create harmony in the
body, regulating levels of hormones and enzymes to create a state
of homeostasis.
Catuaba
- Native to Brazil and parts of the Amazon, Catuaba is
a central nervous system stimulant commonly used throughout the
world for treating sexual impotence, exhaustion and fatigue.
Muira Puama
- A South American herb, Muira Puama has been
used to treat impotence for hundreds of years. It is highly sought
after for its strong stimulant qualities.
Oyster Meat -
Historically
known as an aphrodisiac, oyster meat contains flavonoids that have
been shown to stimulate the reproductive system.
L-Arginine -
L-Arginine
is an amino acid which helps to create nitric oxide in the human
body. Nitric oxide is the most essential substance influencing
sexual function in both men and women. Nitric oxide promotes
circulation, resulting in improved blood flow.
Oatstraw -
Used to
treat fatigue and exhaustion, Oatstraw improves brain and nervous
system function and has been used to treat impotence. It is
extremely useful for aiding your body in recovering from
exhaustion, as well as correcting sexual debility.
Nettle Leaf -
Acts as a
diuretic, expectorant and tonic. It is rich in iron and chlorophyll
to clean and nourish the blood.
Cayenne
- Cayenne improves
circulation, increases the metabolic rate and acts as a catalyst
for other herbs.
Pumpkin Seed -
Pumpkin seed is
commonly used to strengthen the prostate gland and promote male
hormone function. Myosin, an amino acid found in pumpkin seeds, is
known to be essential for muscular contractions.
Sarsaparilla -
Found along
the coast of Peru, Sarsaparilla aids in the production of
testosterone and progesterone.
Orchic Substance -
This is an
extract from bovine testes, and is proven to increase testosterone
levels without harmful steroids.
Licorice Root
- Licorice root fights inflammation, as well as
viral, bacterial and parasitic infection. Licorice cleanses the
colon, and enhances microcirculation in the gastrointestinal
lining.
Tribulus
- A natural testosterone enhancer, Tribulus can
improve desire and performance and increase sexual energy. Tribulus
is also an excellent circulatory and heart tonic and can help
dilate arteries. In India it is used as a tonic for the urinary
system.
Ginseng Blend (Siberian, American & Korean)
-
Commonly used by athletes for overall body strengthening,
Ginseng fortifies the adrenal gland, and promotes healthy
circulation. It increases the conversion rate of sugars into the
necessary substrates for the formation of fatty acids in the liver.
Ginseng stimulates the central nervous system, and is a quick
antidote for fatigue.
Astragalus
- Regarded as a potent
tonic for increasing energy levels and stimulating the immune
system, Astragalus has also been employed effectively as a
diuretic.
Boron
- Boron helps to prevent the loss of calcium, phosphorus and
magnesium through the urine.

The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.
Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.

Sorry, I don't get it. What's wrong with a release tag of fr1?
Say you have installed synaptic-0.24-fr1 on your Valhalla box (package
rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche
repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.

Scripting flaw threatens Web servers
A flaw found in newer versions of the PHP Web server scripting language could allow attackers to crash, and in some cases control, computers over the Internet, an open-source developer group announced Monday.
The vulnerability affects versions 4.2.0 and 4.2.1 of PHP, according to the PHP Group. The flaw compromises different computer architectures in different ways: Web servers running on Intel IA-32 hardware could crash, while other systems, including Sun Microsystems' Solaris, could allow the attacker to infiltrate the computer.

It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:

OK I'm upgrading vorbis on my machine and I'm getting

error: failed dependencies:

	libvorbisfile.so.0   is needed by xmms-1.2.5-7
	libvorbisfile.so.0   is needed by tuxracer-0.61-5

This is because the new libvorbis.rpm only has libvorbisfile.so.3
So is this a problem in the other packages depending on
a specific version (libvorbisfile.so.0) rather than on the
generic libvorbis.so ?
 This is a pain. 
 The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:
 rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*
 RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.

exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis
SSH X11 forwarding).
I run exmh routinely from home (broadband) using an XWindows Client tunneled through ssh under <ahem> WinXP.  It works very well in this fashion.
FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)
There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!

">  sh -c 'for f in ""`folders -recurse -fast`"" ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'
Thanks Tom and Jacob. The above works, but without the double quotes: i.e.
sh -c 'for f in `folders -recurse -fast` ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'
I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my ""sh"".
(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't
need special quoting.)

Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)

I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.

My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.

you're definition, he just stole from you.
There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
privileges on.
Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.
The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
activities, but that is mostly just for show.
Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.
If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.
Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
blame law school and my cat.

This thread kind of surprises me... I started coding with C, then C++, and
moved on to Java... And, I think that:
Looks like a case of ""MY experience is comprehensive, YOUR'S is
anecdotal, THEY don't know what they're talking about"".
1.  The people who pay the wages don't give a flyin' heck what programming
language you write things in... they just want it to work.
In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.
My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.
Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.
2.  C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
management over and over again.
Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management
issues, apart from the fact that I frequently need > 4 GB.
It's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff...
If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.
I am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low
level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over
and over again...
You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.
3.  Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform...
Buzzword.
a monolithic set of API's or a crap load of different API's slicing
and dicing the same problems 50 different ways?
Unsupported assertion.
4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you
can't possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within
the same magnitude of cost as Java....
Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.
5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the
individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is
to reverse engineer C (large applications).
You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.
6.  Hardware is getting so fast that I'm not sure if the performance
difference between Java and C/C++ are relevant any more.
Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.
The end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved.
Yes.
And for those problems, languages such as Java, SmallTalk, and others
allow you to think more high level than low level.  Thinking of bits
and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important
problems....
It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.
Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.
Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems
over and over again [...]
Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.
I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

    Yeah, I need to work this out, too; I just learned my lesson about living on the bleeding edge. Lesson learned?  NO MORE XIMIAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  Man, that was annoying.
    Anyway, I have returned to Redhat 7.3 on my root filesystem (saved my home directories, music and games on other partitions) and while I have the 8.0 stuff in the list, everything I want to upgrade requires 200+ RPMs.
    I'm not opposed to this, but apt is.  ""apt-get dist-upgrade"" dumps core.
    What's the inside secret here, or do I just start searching mirrors for the ISO and get over it?

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
Actually, you use both.

No, even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good 
electrochemical energy sources. But you can recharge and discharge them 
very quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. 
Ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires 
few moments or minutes afterwards.
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
200 MPH should be no problem.
I don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The
traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.

Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00
_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 
I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 
On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 
I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. 
In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 
In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 
I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 
I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 
I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. 
Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI
[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

"I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.
Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).
Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.
So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails

Is something I'm reading now.
My impression is that France is not anywhere near the ""Permit Raj""
nightmare that India is (and became).  Nor has its market been closed
like India's has.
But De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so.  He hasn't
dealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru,
Philippines, and Egypt.  In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it
was 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company.  
In the
Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years.  In Egypt, 
about 80%
of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially
illegal.
India hasn't been helped by its socialism.  Socialism has certainly
helped strangle the country in permits.  But perhaps De Soto is right
that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the
legal, official property system.
Putting most of the people in the property system was something 
the west
only finished about 100 years ago, or Japan did 50 years ago.  It 
wasn't
easy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it.

So upgrading gnome will fix the problem, it's not an exmh/tktcl
issue.
It did for me, but I am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as
other apps seemed to work OK for cut and paste and Tk does its
clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. So I'm not
about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.
Also, I am not talking about installing Gnome2. Just updating the
many, many pieces of gnome to the current rev level.

Your vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEY
WELCOME to Crop Idol  your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-world corn circle. 
The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.
Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.
Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it may be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).
Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.
Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.
Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers  while others are convinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.
Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly and on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. 
Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields on the nights that circles appear.
Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from ancient religions, mathematics and even music. 
Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appear throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the south of England.
Theories about their cause include whirlwinds  known to circle experts as plasma vortexes  earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the human mind.
In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.
Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last night: ""It's a great unsolved mystery.
""We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for sure what is making them.""

I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.
Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.
The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.
All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

My proposed solution to the first two problems you mention is to be
less ambitious. The idea is that you *never* commit - instead, you
simply revert to base state on reboot.
Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than
VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use
a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that
let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.
But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
drives become cheaper.
Obviously, you can't do this with partitions that accrue important
state, e.g. a partition that stores database table data.
... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a
mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of
access control management to decide who can do what to the writable
partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security
problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.
Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)
My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
help.
I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
product, I'd love to hear about it.

"If you need to store a database password, then
clearly the first step is to store the text outside the

so that at least an attacker has to get two different things.
Also, don't get full privileges - create a user account that
is GRANTed very limited access.
However, you can often do better than this if security
is critical.  Create a separate program which has these
database keys (as noted above), and make the web program
contact IT.  Create a very limited protocol that ONLY

operations later).  There's a performance hit, which you're

Subject: [dgc.chat] First public release of NeuDist Distributed Transaction
Clearing	Framework

Reply-To: <dgcchat@lists.goldmoney.com>
I'm happy to announce the first public release of NeuDist
NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications
for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform.
This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers.
Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in Java/XML development.
There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available
in the next release.
The framework currently contains the following:
- Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy.
- Storage framework for ""Named Objects"".
- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations)
- Simple SOAP client
- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named
  Objects"".
- Current types of ""Named Objects"" include:
    NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication
 	Framework
    AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using
	digital signatures.
Next major release is scheduled to contain:
 - Core:
	hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level 	NameSpaces
 - Signing Services:
	Implementation of web based signing services
	End user hosted signing service
 - Example User Authentication Application
 - Example Payment System based on NeuDist
I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things.
Read more about NeuDist or download our early version at
http://neudist.org

When reviewing the Toshiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA.

"Is it possible to use new apt to do (null) to RH8 upgrade?
It might be, don't think anyone tried it yet.
Even if it's possible, are there good reasons why maybe I should not do it and
just use the RH iso's (I don't think RH8 will upgrade from (null), maybe up2date
will)?
Yes ;)
first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released 
version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they 
sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your 
own.
second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been 
changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release 
anyway"".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this 
from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.
If you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;)

"Hello Unlimited International Telephone Call Marketer,
If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:
http://www.internationalfreecall.com
If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.
Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.
In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.
You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.
Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:
1-410-608-8178# 
Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!
Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.
If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.
In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

"I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.
These are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here.  (Is that permitted? :)
I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.
What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.
I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.

Hi!

Is there a command to insert the signature using a combination of keys and not
to have sent the mail to insert it then?
I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.
There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).
And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...
somewhere at rtfm.mit.edu... ok, here we go:

Hope this helps.

"FROM THE DESK OF: Dr tom eke.
E-Mail:dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com
LAGOS - NIGERIA. 
ATTN:  
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. 
It is with my profound dignity that I write you this
very important
and highly confidential letter. First, I must
solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and ""TOP SECRET"".
Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met
each other before,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the
end of the day. We
have decided to contact you by email due to the
urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed that
it will take at
least a minimum of two to three weeks for a normal
post to reach you,
so we decided it is best using the e-mail,which is
quicker and also
to enable us meet up with the second quater payment
for the year
2000. 
However, let me start by introducing myself properly
to you. I
am Dr.tom eke, a Director General in the Department
Of Petroleum 
Resources(D.P.R) and I presently head The Contract
Award Panel incharge
of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. I came to
know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to
handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring
maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top
Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties
include Evaluation, Vetting, Approval for payment of
Contract jobs
done for the D.P.R e.t.c. In order to commence this
business we
solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer
into your Account
the said funds. The source of this funds is as
follows: In the second
quarter of 2001 this committee was mandated to
review and award
contracts to the tune of US$400 million US dollars
to a group of five
firms for the supply construction and installation
of Oil Pipe lines
in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this process my
colleagues and I
decided and agreed among ourselves to deliberately
over-inflate the
total contract sum from US$400 million to US$431
million United
States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum
of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves. 
The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the
second quater of	
year 2001 approved the sum of US$431 million for us
as the contract sum, 
and the sum of US$400 million has also been paid to
the foreign companies 
concerned as contract entitlements for the various
contracts done, but 
since the companies are entiltled to US$400 million
dollars only, we are 
now left with US$31 million dollars balance in the
account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our
positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do
this by ourselves,
as we are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau
(Civil Service
Laws) from opening and/or operating foreign accounts
in our names
while still in Government service, making it
impossible for us to
acquire the money in our names right now. I have
therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust and urgency by my
colleagues in the
panel to look for an overseas partner into whose
account we would
transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we are
writing you this
letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company
can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our
behalf, you or your
Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31
million), while
70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10%
will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred
both local and
foreign in the cause of this transfer. Needless to
say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return we demand your
complete honesty and trust. 
You must however NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based 
on the following terms and conditions as we have
stated below; 
a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence 
b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality 
c) That you will not ask for more share or try to
sit on the funds once it is under
your custody, or any form of blackmail. 
d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release
the funds as instructed 
by us after you have removed your share of 20% from
the total amount. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude
this transaction seven to fourteen bank working days
from the date 
of receipt of the necessary requirements from you .
We are looking 
forward to doing business with you and solicit your
Total Confidentiality
in this transaction. There is no cause for alarm. I
give you my word that you
are completely safe in doing business with us.
Transactions like this
have been successfully carried out in the past by
most Government
executives. Here in my country there is great
economic and political
disarray and thus looting and corruption is rampant
and the order of
the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how
money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because
everyone is
making desperate attempts to secure his or her
future, so that when
we retire from active service we donot languish in
poverty. I will
explain more to you when I have heard from you. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above e-mail address. 
I will bring you into the complete picture of this
pending business
transaction when I have heard from you and also
receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me
fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our
pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private
telephone and fax
numbers where you can always reach me. Your urgent
response will be
highly appreciated to enable us transfer the funds
under the second
quarter of the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless. 
Yours faithfully, 
Dr.tom eke. 
N.B. PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT THIS BUSINESS
TRANSACTION IS 100% LEGAL
AND COMPLETELY FREE FROM DRUG MONEY OR MONEY
LAUNDERING. THIS IS A
COMPLETE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

Works like a charm. It's like the box was on drugs or something. 

However, while testing it a selected my favourite folder (l-k) and 
marked ~400 messages unread. THAT took forever, or about as long as 
Catch-up Unseen did before. Any suggestions?
That's fixed now.  I thought I'd caught all the occurrences of that particular

=======================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:
“To whom it may concern,
I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70’s & 80’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?
Sincerely,
RJ”

“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.”

Location: West Coast, USA
“I’m a man of my 40’s and I really know my stuff.  I don’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple “3”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!”

Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craft….  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM)…. Four or five draws of your pipe….as is the magical way….lingers for a good, goodly while!!!  (An herb pipe and usage instructions are included with each Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) Package.)

"That always amazes me about 'regular' dreams - how often they come true.
In 1993 or so, when I was a student in Edinburgh, I had a bad dream about
being chased around a house by a scary murderous tramp who was carrying a
bag full of half-penny coins (which had long since ceased to be legal
tender). The next morning as I left the flat, I found a half-penny on the
doormat right outside our door. Fair gave me the willies, that did.

What do spammers do with email addresses in

them?
Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)
I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
got around to making them spamtraps.
So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
the majority of them don't work.
If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
because again it's easy to trace you.
So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.
Everyone else doesn't really care.
That's my view anyway. :)

  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings
  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network
  ###
  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.
  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.
  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.
  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.
  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.
  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""
  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""
  About Magi
  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms
  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration
  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can
  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and
  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work
  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming
  unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent
  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as
  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical
  interface, and universal name spaces generating ""follow me URLs"" for mobile
  professionals.

Just curious if subject line capitalization can be used as an indicator.
Either the percentage of characters that are caps..
Or, percentage starting with a capital letter (if number of words > xx)
Supply a mod to tokenizer.py and I'll test it (eventually <wink>).  Note
that the tokenizer already *preserves* case in subject-line words, because
experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this
specific context (but experiment also showed-- against my
expectations --that preserving case everywhere didn't make a significant

this).",0,0

Eek.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
Outputting a message in %post and providing a README of some kind would
be better, as well as perhaps adding a note in %description.
Why ""Eek""? :-)
If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/
My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.

I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50
Mac OS X Tips
is in publication 
and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have 
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means 
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've 
written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, 
I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will 
find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things 
on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.
Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing 
sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the 
contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is 
truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and 
Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which 
will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be 
primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom 
of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. 
If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the 
sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris 
and Randy.
I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months 
and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going 
to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what 
your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with 
some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting 
topics. Either way, I'm open to some
AppleScript suggestions
.

Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE
http://www.searchstandard.com/
While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning 
off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the 
preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local 
machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on 
search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of 
SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it 
possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site 
won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make 
finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, 
that much easier.

Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48
http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html
Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like 
intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those 
services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark 
when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. 
The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, 
ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service 
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your 
local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending 
you a message when those services go down. The interface allows 
for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail 
account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via 
a sound from your machine.
GnomeTERMINAL
For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you 
need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly 
useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely 
different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions 
relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the 
Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From 
the command line type:
sudo chown username filename
You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for 
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will 
replace filename.

As we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it 
remains important to understand where things evolved from. Susan 
Kare designed all the original icons for the Mac OS, way back in 
1983. In fact, that smiling Mac that appears as OS X boots is her 
creation. Check out her collection of UI artwork, from both Windows 
and Mac operating systems. Also available from Kare.com are Kare

GnomeTIP
Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a 
particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of 
the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" 
related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store 
information on recently made changes to a file, information from others 
who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers 
and other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.

"Long time no chat!
How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""
Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 
Here is the bottom line ...
I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.
BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

My Dear ,
Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.
My name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la
 st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.
During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc
 ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.
Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;
1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 
Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.
Best Regards, 
Mr.David Kargbou and family.

"Good idea!
This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love to
devote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addresses
to giving the Chinese unfettered net access.
In a sense, this is what the ""peek-a-booty"" project does:
   http://www.peek-a-booty.org
But let's play out the next few moves:
Good Guys: Google enables SSL access
 Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domains
Good Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty)
 Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewall
Good Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity
 Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish
           software
Good Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software
 Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using
           monitoring-disabling-software
...and on and on.
The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising the
costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, brings
social liberalization sooner rather than later.

Subject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?
[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the
article I was commenting on... Rohit]
In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.
The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in
the article.
Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest
of the Web?
To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.
On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...
Best,
   Rohit Khare

The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Google—up to a point
Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition
IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,
is gougou, meaning “doggy”. For the country's fast-growing population of
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked
access to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been
restored.
An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.
After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site
to far less powerful search engines in China.
Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on
Google for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China—
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes.",0,0

The speed is a problem for sure - It takes a long time to do the
rescanning of sequences (I associate it with hitting the 'flist'
button, or when my background flist goes off).    I'm running on a
pretty fast system (Athlon 1700+, 512Mb RAM, 10k RPM ultra SCSI disk)
and hitting flist used to take no more than a second.  The big
difference might just be perception, because the the old code just
updated all the folders (count + color) all at once, instead of making
it look like there is 0 unseen, then counting its way back up.  

I doubt I'll have much time in the immediate future to hack at this,
but if I do - can you suggest areas that might be the best to
optimize?   If not, do you think we can put in some preferences to
disable some of the more intensive features?   I'd rather disable all
the sequence support (except unseen, of course) and have reasonable
speed.   I suspect people on slow machines would find the current
state unusable.
If I knew where the problem was, I'd fix it myself.
Finding it is probably more work than the actual fix.

Thanks.  I'm not sure I'll need it with the new sequence code, but I
might.  Does your new code commit sequences immediately?  The old code
didn't, so I put that in to help keep my mh and exmh windows in sync.
Yes it does.

<p>Lorenzo writes...</p>
<p>I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.</p>
<p>PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.</p>
<p>Alex writes...</p>
<p>My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.</p>
<p>Thank you for a product that has really helped us!</p>
<p>Glen writes...</p>
<p>In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.</p>

"Quoting Paul Linehan (plinehan@yahoo.com):
The point here is that (under French law) the author can change the
terms of the licence arbitarily. This is because any granting of
rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long,
where, to whom, dates and times.
The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)
In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right
to change his software back to closed on a whim.
No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary (""closed"" [sic]) licence.  
Rick Moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting
of rights which are not default. 

See the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to
be explicitly specified - under French law.
The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
contract law.
This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
subject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.

BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A JET?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in
the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's
sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.
The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the
bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be
traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened
except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White
House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the
first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the 
major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2
billion in the past year.)
Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in
pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce
competition from discounters, a too-small area of service
concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with
United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business.
Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years
ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by
United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators
that it was too small to survive on 
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.
Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those
likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has
vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their
jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of
millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially
plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a
bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter
who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one
creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we
soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word
from the folks getting stiffed.)
Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which
observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability""
thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that
anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is
plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas 
Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and
pocketed 11 times its investment.
Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways
customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York
Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor
frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use
U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner,
United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, 
there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next
major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel

REMEMBER GLOBAL CROSSING?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories
fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this
summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global
Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to 
recall the fuss over chads.
The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday
a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be 
holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because 
the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention,
especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the
Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to
say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed 
for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and
that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back
in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three
times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian
conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. 
Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the
deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the 
regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two 
investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and
bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the
slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The
company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the
crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for 
the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times
quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend 
its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. 
But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is
simply buying low so it can sell higher. 
Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is
approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary
Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock,
as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom
bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah

"The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.
A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at

The Disappearing Alliance
By Dale Franks 10/08/2002
For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.
Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.
Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.
The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.
European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.
On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.
At least, for now.
Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.
The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.
Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.
None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.
That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

1. Do you consider yourself ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
2. Are you still looking for a very Real Business that can provide you and
  your family with the lifestyle you desire and deserve?
Or,just a second
  income in your spare time?
3. Would you invest $66.50 (A 25% discount off of our regular price of
  $99.95 during this limited time promotion. ) in a business that could make you
  ""FINANCIALLY SECURE""?
If so, read on:
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but, it is a way for you to get into
  a business with a minimal investment and, may be your first step towards a
  rewarding first, or second income. For the longest time, only those, who were
  able to make large investments were able to take advantage of this type of a
  business. We have made it possible for everyone to do it, and at a price
  everyone can afford.
Corporate America has conditioned us to believe that security comes from
  employment. Yet layoffs are hitting an all time high, major corporations are
  failing and we hope to never become the victims of this downsizing, career
  burn out, illness or injury.
There was a time, when finding another job was not a problem, but today,
  the frightening reality for a lot of people is that
""the
  plastic in their wallets determines the quality of their lives.""
The hard facts show that our economy has moved from the industrial age
  into the INFORMATION, SERVICE AND RETAIL AGE. No longer can you depend on the
  corporation to provide your family with the security you seek.

Heheheh... So becomming a university professor was your second career

Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had 
many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.
As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

"I attended the same conference, and was impressed by a few systems that
Jim didn't mention. In terms of CMS, the following all had apparently
been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some
pretty strong competition to commercial systems:
- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content
management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS
- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.example.com/software/ccm/cms/
- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.org
There was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source
strength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement
towards improving that situation.
I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for
granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it
just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore
XML almost completely. 
I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used to
apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how
completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration
of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the
occasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that was
functional): this seems more the case in open source content management
than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to
ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).
The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of
current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd written
down what he said, something like ""it sucks so extremely, it sucks so
widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is
no hope."" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial
systems scaled so well that the commercial ""big boys"" were really much
more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, ""OK, take
some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale
pretty well."" Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): ""content management
problems are either trivial or impossible.""
Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3
each of Mac, Linux, Windows.
I am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, a
CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:
http://subversion.tigris.org/
I'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home
safely, they said they'd only been in America four days but were already
homeless...

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.
Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.",0,0

"PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606
July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET
       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.
       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""
       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.
       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""
       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""
###   ###   ###
Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
interviews on this topic.

As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a
startling revelation
that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!
Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
Things that make you go hmmmm...

SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp
During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.
SQL Server Cumulative Patch
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp
A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clark
http://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html
Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown

Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be

different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping

curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?

"Hmm - I'm cc'ing the exmh-workers list, because I really don't know

talk about ""issues"" with the latest version of gpg.

17:09:31
EDT 2001 i686 unknown
Tk 8.3 Tcl 8.3

It's not clear to me this is a bug with exmh per se, but it's something 
that
manifests through exmh, so I figured asking you might help me track it 
down.

When I receive a gpg encrypted message, and it asks me for a passphrase, 
it
first tries to ask me via the tty under which exmh is running. It tells 
me m
     y 
passphrase is incorrect every time, at which point exmh offers me the 
line i
     n 
the message about decrypting. I click the line and it offers me the 
dialog
box, and tells me the passphrase is correct, and shows me the decrypted 
message.

Any ideas on that?

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.
Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single

My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze

a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the

I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd
suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is
showing up, right?
Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust
out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,
as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a
real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:
""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the
Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians
would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...)
But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,
lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and
an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe
or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist
congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist
bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I
used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.
I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I
show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a
civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing
with them. :-).
Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.
I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one
year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married
her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was
just looking to make friends as I was new in town.
The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation
you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some
guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can
practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a
room...
That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most
regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in
protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,
looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.
You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at
least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there
are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics
- -- but I won't go there, I promise.
If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure
that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's
religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of
assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near
you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I
did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

"Both Move and Link are one-click actions.
<Button-3> on a folder label Move's the current message
<Shift-Button-3> on a folder label Link's the current message
Robert Elz said:
    Date:        Thu, 12 Sep 2002 23:26:33 -0500
    From:        Hal DeVore <haldevore@acm.org>
    Message-ID:  <23204.1031891193@dimebox>

  | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).

Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.

  | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
  |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.

Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.

But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".

Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally
     ).

  | How's spring shaping up ""down under""?

No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.    In any case,
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...

"""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is
highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological
timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.
There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.
The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human
activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating
after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that
these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for
increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.
It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited
during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of
humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers
paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a
bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried
in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the
ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save
the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their
existence has always been transient.
Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the
past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming
isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to
understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on
global human activity.
For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are
anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll
just stick with Occam's Razor for now.
The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.
It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment
subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the
current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2
concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth
should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may
be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I
encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to
eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident
as heat.

"802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Hat... I tried Mandrake, SuSE, Debian, Slackware and my favorite of all of 
them is Red Hat. 
Actually I use Red Hat 7.3.
I visited the web site Freshrpms, I congratulated Thias for his work.

"(Fax) to  my direct confidential  Fax No: 234 1 7591666  
Dr. Kataga Bakori
Lagos, Nigeria.
23rd July 2002
Attention President/C.E.O
                   
Dear Sir,
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.
Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is by virtue of its nature as 
being utterly confidential and top secret. A member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council 
(N.E.P.C.) who was part of the federal government delegation to your country during a trade 
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential operation with 
you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and 
hope that you keep it top secret because of the nature of the business.
Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of engineering and 
projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top officials, we have under our 
control as overdue contract payments, bills totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, 
which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a 
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual 
account to receive the funds.
The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government here in Nigeria 
which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set up companies and awarded 
themselves various contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries.  The 
present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors 
and as a result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending which we 
have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for payment.  However by virtue 
of our position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I was 
therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas 
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of  US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY 
ONE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.
 the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign contractors l debts owed 
so as to maintain an amiable relationship with foreign governments and non-government 
financial agencies.  We have decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation 
of some officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank of Nigeria 
(C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a good company account or 
any other offshore bank account into which we can remit this money by acting our main 
partner and trustee or acting as the original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of 
account information and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for 
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply for payment, 
and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of your company.  This process 
would be an internal arrangement with the departments concerned.
I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist 
us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 
million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for 
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.
The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m hindrance to the successful 
execution of this transaction.  I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will 
not disappoint me. 
I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your 
knowledge when I have heard from you.
Thanks for your co-operation,
Yours faithfully,
Dr. Kataga Bakori

Many spammers make money not from response to the spam, but from selling
the service of spamming on behalf of someone else.  You might track down
whoever paid for the mailing, but tracking down the actual sender might be
more difficult, and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer
they haven't stopped the spammer, so the benefit is strictly to Habeas,
not to the recipients of the spam.  That's the main problem I have with
the whole scenario: My pain, Habeas's gain, and those most likely to be
held liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers.

The only thing I actually miss in that regard is support for S/MIME.
You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on

Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.
My concern doesn't stem from failing to understand how your business is
intended to work.  My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it
will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.
Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but
the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.
So, I can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track
spammers down when it's never really been tried.
Please don't misquote me.  I did not assert that you ""can't track
spammers"".  Here is what I said:
| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in
| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good
| example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.
I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam.
Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself
on your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to
only license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all
violators on the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will
quickly remove us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill
Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise.
I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score.  I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.
I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive
score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's
inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can
increase the magnitude of the score.

If the creator didnt say you could have it without paying, it's theft,
so
simple, hell that's even in all the major holy books.
Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the
Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,
too.
In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was
actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into
slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to
the term 'man stealer' in a way I didn't understand.
Yep, I know he said all holy books.  No, I don't know if this site was
blowing hot air.  It just read like someone had done their homework.

However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this

(
OTCBB: NNCO
).  If you tuned 
      in 
      to our last two picks, you would have noticed that ,  PRCT went from a close 
      of $.025 to a high of $0.12.  That's a 300% gain in just two days.  
      Our other
pick, HUMT, almost gained over  200%. PLAY OF THE WEEK tracks stocks on downward trends, foresees 
      bottom and notify our subscribers of it potential upward movement.  We 
      also look for newly trading companies, and stocks that by comparing 
      trading history and shares in the marketplace we believe have great levity 
      upward.

PLAYOF THE WEEK.  Our trademark is our 
      uncanny ability to spot stocks that have bottomed-out and anticipate their 
      rebound and upward trend.  Most of the stocks we track rebound and 
      peak within just two days, giving investors opportunity to make a few 
      bucks back in such a highly volatile market.  We don't believe the 
      market is such as to take any long-term positions right now.  But in 
      a highly unstable marketplace, the opportunities for short-term stabs 
      (gains) are abundant.  When the question today seems to be which way 
      is up, we like to think that from the bottom there is no other way---it's 
      all a matter of 
timing.

Uh... the reason is simple. Habeas runs something called the 
""Habeas Infringers List"", and if you use their trademark without 
their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam.
Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
town on violators.
The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.

Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime
every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.
The people who pour the espresso aren't rich.  An interesting issue
might be how it affects employment.
Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a
difference.  
The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous.
Worse than the cost of the tax itself.

Yes it does. And if you're missing the dependencies needed for the selected

I'll have no problem at all with this and you get my
vote on this one. 

One problem with alsa-kernel that I've experienced:
everytime RH issues a new kernel update, I have to
rebuild my alsa-kernel to match the new kernel.
Yup... unfortunately the alsa-kernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel,
and there's no way of avoiding it.

I don't think I've tried yet, but if I did, I probably moved on to another
package after having bumped into one of the problems you mention.
If anyone sends me a patch to my spec file and eventually needed patches
etc., I'd be more than glad to make a new build available.

"I'll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass, however it would seem to 
me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the 
autoform function, providing more info than you want to.  That and some 
entity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the 
first place.
Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to 
market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability 
they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was

What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
industry:

 o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
 o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
 o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
   forms submission.

What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  

I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  

So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
working all that well.

"O'Connor quickly moved his cursor down the left side of the web
page. Then, showing a flash of his silky skills, he cut across to
the right hand side and clicked on Top Ten Special Offers. He zipped
past the Irish Chicken Breast Fillets at 25% off, nipped round the
HB Selections ice cream also at 25% off and went on with the goal
firmly in sight:
  - Budweiser '24 pack 500ml cans'. Was E49.20. Now E42.15. SAVE E7.05*
  - Guinness '24 pack 500ml cans'. Was E50.16. Now E42.33. SAVE E7.83*
With one of his trademark clicks of the mouse he sent his cost-price
cases of beer straight into the back of his online basket.  1 - 0 to
Ireland. From there O'Connor was unstoppable and went on to make it
an unforgettable afternoon as he tucked away another four goals:
  - Pringles Large Tubes 200g. Was E2.05 each. Now buy 2 for E3.00*
  - Hula Hoops Minis Tub 140g. Was E2.42. Now buy one get 2nd half price*
  - Club Twin Packs 2x2 litre. Was E3.10 each.

"Gary Lawrence Murphy:
If we had more variety of franchise food than
the Wendys/KFC/PizzaHut/TacoBell/TimHorton's monopoly .. The USA is a 
nation founded on creative free enterprise entrepreneurs; Canada
is a nation built on monopolies.
Things aren't all that bad. I remember Vancouver
as having a broad variety of good, local eateries.
And Toronto as having a variety of good, local
strip joints. ;-) I never ate a doughnut in
Canada, so I cannot vouch for their quality. I
could live in either of these cities quite happily,
but Carolyn doesn't like cold weather.
Personally, I almost never eat at a franchise
restaurant. Usually you can find better fare or
cheaper fare (and often both!) at a local
restaurant.

Modern Living is a series of about 100 tiny Flash animations that use 
recursions, gloomy music and simple interactivity to make inarticulate yet 
compelling existentialist morality plays. This stuff is like Philip K Dick 
rendered as a series of five-second interactive animations. I've just killed an 
entire hour on this thing, and now I want to go watch a Pinter play. Link[1]

"SpamTalk said:
Probably better than the ""spam phrases"" approach would be the database
approach as currently used for white/black listing.
Any way to tie that to an XML retrieval from a list of central repositories?
Does mySQL do replication? A properly done XML would let us eyeball the list
as well as use it to keep the database up to date.
Another idea: could we synthesize an RBL so that
http://www.spammer.com/spam/web/bug/ becomes spam.web.bug.x.www.spammer.com
for a reverse lookup? It is going to get tricky, how to specify a randomized
intermediate directory?
A good plan, needs an implementation though: 
        http://bl.reynolds.net.au/ksi/email/
hmm. seems down to me.  Basically it's a plan to store hash sums of
URLs/phone numbers found in spam in a DNSBL, for apps like SpamAssassin to
look up.  A little like spamcop's ""spamvertized URL"" list...

Its darn annoying the way RH ship python 1.5.2 and python 2.2 (as python2) 
and libs that only work with one or the other :(

esp. the pgdb and xml modules.

Anyone know why Red Hat insist on sticking with python 1.5.2?
they are on python 2.2 for 8.0 - but they don't like to break
compatibility during major releases.
therefore: 6.X was 1.5.2 b/c that was current
7.x was 1.5.2 b/c that was current when 7.0 was released.

This is due to insufficient write privileges to the ""razor-agent.log""

course, it's better to restrict the access as much as possible).

In Agent.pm, when the Razor2::Logger object is created, if it doesn't 
have write permission to the log file it does not succeed. Then, later 
in the code when the log object is used, it fails with the ""unblessed"" 
error.

Hope this helps,

Thanks Tony, but I think doing it using component files will get a .signature 
by default, but I have many diferent signatures and I want to insert one of 
that signatures using a keyboard command. So for a message I will insert a 
signature, but for another message I will insert a different signature.
Is it possible? I am using sedit for my messages.
Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).
However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.
I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.
Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.
I hope this helps some.

Dear 
Friends
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL 
TV:
Making over half million 
dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for an investment of only $25 U.S. 
Dollars expense one time THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET 
!
=================================================BE IN GOOD MONEY WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Before 
you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been 
hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the 
Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the 
investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make 
people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was 
legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely 
NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow 
the simple instructions, they are bound to make some money with only $25 out of 
pocket cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT 
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED,
IT IS 
CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say:
""I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total 
$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""
Pam Hedland, Fort 
Lee, New 
Jersey.
==================================================Here 
is another testimonial:
""This program has been around for a long time 
but I never believed in it. But one day when I received it again in the mail I 
decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa 
.... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.
The first month 
I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of 
$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have 
made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this 
program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""

If 
you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily 
and
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and 
AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
FOLLOW 
THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, 
GUARANTEED!
INSTRUCTIONS:
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below 
====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
REPORT
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name 
appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON 
YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
=== When 
you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you 
can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 
5=$25.00.
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they 
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case 
something happens to your computer.
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of 
the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in 
any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you 
will lose out on a majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this 
works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this 
method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have 
tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get 
all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to 
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than 
what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the 
reward!!!
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this 
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. 
This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their 
fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 
5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 
4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 
3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 
2
6....
Insert YOUR name & address in 
the REPORT # 1 Position.
PLEASE 
MAKE
SURE you copy every name & address 
ACCURATELY!
=========================================================**** 
Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
Save this on a disk as well just 
in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the 
internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing 
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find 
thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to 
get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL 
LEGALLY
=========================================================Let's 
say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume 
You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that 
the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response could be much better but 
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people will send out hundreds of 
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, 
you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders 
for report # 1.
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail 
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with 
orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.
Those 100 
people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders 
for Report # 3.
Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for 
Report # 4.
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total 
of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders 
for Report #5
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half 
million).
Your total income in this example is:
1..... $50 + 2..... $500 
+ 3..... $5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000
Grand Total=$555,550.00
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A 
PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW 
YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY 
!
========================================================REMEMBER 
FRIENDS, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED 
TO.
Dare to think for a moment what 
would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 
e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet 
worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and 
more!
METHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE 
INTERNET
======================================================Advertising 
on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to 
advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger 
response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as 
you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the 
Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on 
it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the 
report.
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ===================ORDER EACH 
REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) 
for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by 
wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, 
Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL 
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS 
GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
Follow these guidelines to guarantee 
your success:
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
=== After you have 
received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or 
more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails 
until you do.
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 
2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash 
will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name 
is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different 
report.
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER 
BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can 
generate from this business 
!!!
=====================================================FOLLOWING 
IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received 
information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with 
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few 
weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS 
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is 
now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 as 
instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or 
more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out 
the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the 
ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
============ MORE TESTIMONIALS 
===============""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in 
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good 
money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spouting my knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my 
supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made 
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when 
the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had 
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 
147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 
''hobby''.
Mitchell Wolf M.D., 
Chicago, 
Illinois
=====================================================''Not 
being the gambling type, it took several weeks to make up my mind to participate 
in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment 
was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at 
least get my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size post 
office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The 
nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There 
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big.""
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, 
Canada
======================================================''I 
had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should 
have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another 
copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 
months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made 
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks.""
Susan De Suza, New York, 
N.Y.
======================================================''It 
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to 
you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money 
started to come in. My first month I made $20,560.00 and by the end of third 
month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to 
internet."".

HP trims Jornada unit in Singapore
Hewlett-Packard has shuffled employees out of its Jornada Pocket PC development unit in Singapore, as the company continues to cut costs following its merger with Compaq Computer.
Jornada products are developed in Singapore and will be phased out by year's end, with the exception of Jornada 720, which resembles a mini-notebook. The model will eventually be rebranded as an HP iPaq device.

"Hi - 
I upgraded to 2.40 (now 2.41) last week and the messages which are definitely in the DCC database aren't being marked as such by spamassassin when connected to via spamc. Interestingly it is detected when running spamassassin -t < sample-spam.txt (using the same userid incidentally). Is this a known ""feature"" of spamc under 2.4x or is there anything obvious that I am not implementing correctly? Note that as I implied above this used to work under 2.3x of spamassassin and spamd/spamc

It's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  We use it all,
always.  It's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  ""Lucid"" is
a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
but we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.
For example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.
The sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a ""turning on""
of circuits, it is a ""tuning in"".  The next step, of course, is to
""drop out"" :)
To paraphrase an old saw: Life is wasted on the living.

Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short 
loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. 
I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another 
runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. 
Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. 
And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. 
There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.",0,0

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function 
check_for_content_type_just_html(). Do you probably have some old rules 
files still lurking around? This test existed in 2.31 but is gone/was 
renamed with 2.40.

I guess it's time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As 
many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument 
for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. 
I'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would 
be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked 
me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still 
can't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to 
Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to 
have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than 
me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by 
camping in line with us. 
So, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an 
Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth 
Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd 
like to come with us, let me know. 
I was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who 
couldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with 
official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is 
outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an 
interesting account. 
In a related irony, today was ""Disney Day"" at Borders[5], where they played 
Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit 
of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of 
Programming_. 
In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, 
I highly recommend it.

Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.

They don't, I can guarantee that.  Quite a few spamtraps nowadays
operate by 5nn'ing for 6 months in the hope of getting legit mailers
to remove bouncing addrs from lists;  then after 6 months, they just
spamtrap all incoming mail to those addrs.  (unfortunately a lot of
legit mailers don't bother cleaning their lists either.)
Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.
A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.

"My gut reaction would be to tell them to go and shite, but this might not help to solve the problem. People who do horsey gigs get insurance because they can prove that they are 'expert'. They can then get a quote. What about finding out what they are prepared to insure, and then tell them that you are pulling in your horns and will do what you are insured to do, and make sure no one chops up any one else.
Best of luck

Robert Harley:
It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
precisely identical between males and females.
Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.
Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.
Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

Cool --- I wasn't aware that the US had lifted it's population out of
poverty!  When did this happen?  I wonder where the media gets the
idea that the wealth gap is widening and deepening...

"Once upon a time, Mark wrote :
I remember apt-get dist-upgrading from 7.2 to 7.3 fine, so it -should- 
work, maybe :)
I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
(unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.
Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.
As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)

the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?

./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
One thing I _think_ you might be doing slightly wrong is your
specification of prefixes.  --prefix is the directory to be used as root
for _installing_ files.  Typically packages use /usr/local as default
(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in
/usr/local/doc and so forth).
Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not
further specify things like --exec-prefix.
Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in
which case ignore me!
That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
make
At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
make: *** [w3] Error 2

When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
the commands I used.
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
I'd make the same remarks about prefixes here.  I would use the command
    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local
To get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is
    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/
(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local
Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp
A command you would have found useful would have been
    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print
Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.
A program which is very useful is checkinstall
http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
It allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).
Instead of ""make install"" type ""checkinstall"", and a package is put
together and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be.

I thought I baked my Dell PowerEdge 1400SC server yesterday 
when it refused to boot completely. I borrowed a data vac 
from a friend and decided to clean all of the dust and cat 
hair from my systems, then after reconnecting everything, 
the server would boot to the initial splash screen, where 
there is a POST progress bar, but would not proceed past 
past about the first 1/5th of the bar. Uh-oh. What did I 
fry?
As it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the 
small stuff"". Oh, I had all of the cables plugged back in to 
the server properly, I checked all of that, but it didn't 
dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that 
I should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the 
cables. That server is connected to an 8-port Compaq KVM 
switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, 
the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a 
tad. Why the server didn't display a keyboard warning 
message like every other computer on the planet, I can only 
attribute to the BIOS developers. Server Satchel, running 
Red Hat Linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. The 
penguin is happy. The server case is even black. How 
appropriate...

Windows XP Security Checklist
Finely crafted by Bernie Klinder
http://www.labmice.net/articles/winxpsecuritychecklist.htm
With all of the security features crammed into Windows XP, 
where does one start? Do you need VPN capability? Is NTFS an 
appropriate file system choice for you? Is there any value 
at all in Simple File Sharing? After much hounding, Bernie 
Klinder has drawn up a healthy checklist of things you need 
to address under Windows XP in order to maintain a system 
that is both security and compatible with the rest of your

ATI Still Makes Video Cards?
http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.html?i=1656
Say it isn't so! Yes, apparently they do still have 
something to say about NVIDIA's dominance in the video card 
market. Seeing as how they've been all but dumped by the 
majority of top-tier system makers, it's hard to believe 
that they are capable of a serious comeback. Judging from 
what AnandTech has to say about the forthcoming R300-based 
cards, it appears that they haven't thrown in the towel just 
yet. I'm all for competition, so I welcome the effective re-
entrance into the high end market. Let's all hope that their 
driver development has improved as much as their hardware 
seems to have.

Technical Censorship
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-944315.html
Odd. I liked that cup of Mocha (spelled M-O-C-H-A and I'll explain in a minute) I drank at Starbucks when Jake and I visited last week, but if I wanted to relay that to someone using a Yahoo email account, you might see an alternate word. Thus the additional hyphenated spelling just in case those of you using Yahoo to subscribe to Lockergnome actually received your issues and the word has been altered to suit their personal opinion of my choice in drinks. They've also had a terrible time interpretting our W3C standardized HTML lately, dropping in copious #message references throughout the text in their new Beta email client. So why the text replacement? It's another filtering technique to stop certain words that might relate to JavaScript functions. I guess I'll have to choose another beverage next time. Silly me.
GnomeSTUFF
Yer Kidding... Really?
http://www.theregus.com/content/4/25629.html
I'm all sorts of sarcastic today, aren't I? Those of us 
that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with 
math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and 
personnel costs. It's not really that difficult. It's 
certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of 
Linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do 
some file sharing, printing and maybe an Intranet page or 
three is far cheaper than using Windows. At very long last, 
Microsoft has admitted as much. Of course, they're quick to 
point out that they have much more to offer than Linux, 
which may indeed be true. But at the end of the day, when 
you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one 
another, Linux is cheaper. For a shop of Windows-trained 
staff, dealing with Linux will certainly be a challenge, 
requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here 
and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed 
configuration. On the same token, make a Linux whiz use 
Windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a 
replacement. Cheap is in the budget of the beholder.
Recommend It!

"Greetings!
You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in 
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is 
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time 
mailing, so no removal is necessary.
If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, 
MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that 
has ever landed in your Inbox.
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE
MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, 
their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally 
flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.
The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to 
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.
HERE'S GOOD NEWS
There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think!
With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to 
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of 
this before.
I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one 
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the 
information. Period.
To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type 
""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you 
within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.
Cordially,
Siddhi
P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most 
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I 
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And 
it's FREE!

new era of instability
marked by fears of terrorist attacks, corporate accounting scandals, and a stock market meltdown. CNET News.com recently spoke with Burkhardt about the technology challenges the NYSE regularly faces because of the whipsaw movements of the stock market.

Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET

MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.

Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.

They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.

But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.

""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""

This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong 
about the safety of a smart card.  

What do you think ?
That's similar to using hard-locks (either the old parallel, or the new
usb).
The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but the rest of
the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card, or
peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.

AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks
If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.
According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, ""the No.
1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
[New York's] Upper East Side.
""It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store""
on Madison Avenue, which features ""rich vulnerable women,"" the mag's
October issue says.
AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
place published, or being cited as the ""in"" place for finding loaded women
- or rather, women who are loaded.
""The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!"" an AA
spokesman told The Post.

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

Requiring a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possible, no, except
maybe by stopping the build process if it isn't found... but that's errr...
ugly!
And I really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources, the
easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too...
Yes, it is...  But then alsa-driver requires alsa-kernel, and I don't quite 
like --nodeps...
This would be a tricky one since to use the ""--with <name>"" feature of
rpmbuild, I think you'd need to add individual handling of each and every
card :-/
That's ok.  I was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway, not 
for some real-world need :).
That's what the ""alsa-driver"" is there for, create all the base files
excluding the kernel drivers. What I would suggest for dependency reasons
it to install an ""alsa-kernel"" for the original kernel (you've kept it,
right? ;-)) and install ALSA modules from source for custom kernels built
from source.
Um...  I keep 2.4.18-12.2 for emergency sitations (like I forget to include 
keyboard support in kernel, dumb me), but alsa-kernel_2.4.18-10 does not 
require kernel-2.4.18-10, so that's ok.

Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed

By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON 
 
What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and
complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin
towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as
part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in
Lower Manhattan. 
Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated
insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the
confidential material contains data and expert analysis
developed by some of the nation's most respected
engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that
have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the
crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,
helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to
the collapses. 
An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the
debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been
accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what
government analysts have been able to put together as they
struggle to answer the scientifically complex and
emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly
failures of the buildings. 
But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of
victims fear that the closely held information, which
includes the analysis and the possible answers that
families and engineers around the world have craved, may
remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. 
Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the
experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they
wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are
typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it
now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that
certain material can remain secret for the time being - has
approved standard legal arrangements that, should the
lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial
material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. 
""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but
we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,
an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,
who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why
Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd
edition, 2002). 
""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole
process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. 
Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the
south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper
Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.
""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I
would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a
moral obligation."" 
The lawsuit that has generated the information involves
Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the
trade center property, and a consortium of insurance
companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner
that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist
attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half
that amount, as the insurance companies say. 
As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert
opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. 
Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of
Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said
of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements
that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He
conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20
insurers on his side of the case could complicate any
release of the material. 
As for his own company, whose consultants alone have
produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of
diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt
would be made to give the material eventually to ""public
authorities and investigative teams."" 
Still, some of that analysis relies on information like
blueprints and building records from other sources, like
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built
and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in
the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the
differing origins of the material would influence his
company's ability to release information. 
In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents
would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with
applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate
with ""federal investigations."" 
The fate of the research is particularly critical to
resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,
given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into
the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few
resources, a lack of access to crucial information like
building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.
A new federal investigation intended to remedy those
failings has just begun at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has
studied many building disasters. 
Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make
final determinations and recommendations for other
buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded
up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on
the lawsuit. 
Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of
the real estate executive's own heavily financed
investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to
say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST
investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was
in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but
said no transfer had taken place. 
With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by
both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body
of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the
trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. 
""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said
Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner
at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier
inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the
future."" 
Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one
governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,
from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such
information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the
reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to
have them sealed forever. 
""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep
some of those documents secret for one reason or another,
some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First
Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. 
Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the
information, the court might look favorably on requests to
make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the
material is unnerving to many people, especially experts
who believe that only a complete review of the evidence -
not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect
their own interests - could lead to an advance in the
federal investigation of the trade center. 
""It's important for this to get presented and published and
subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,
director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure
Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the
case, ""because then the general engineering community can
sort it out."" 
The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by
any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger
Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called
upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with
the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of
the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. 
The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of
the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged
core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and
proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -
which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped
pinpoint the structural failures. 
The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer
modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to
the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks
immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints
hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to
the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of
Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a
consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he
had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground
zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how
the towers fell. 
Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things
actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the
specific locations."" 
Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details
of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details
of computer calculations his company has done on the spread
of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.
Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of
photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of
which he believes have not been available to other
investigators. 
And the investigation has not limited itself to computers
and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind
tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining
the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed
the weakening structures. 
Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort
Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but
had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the
original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For
the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more
detailed measurements than in the original design."" 
""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in
themselves for understanding how wind and buildings
interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be
valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think
I've told you all I can.""

* EFF Submits Letter to FCC Chairman Regarding BPDG Proposal
The Honorable Michael K. Powell Chairman Federal Communications
Commission 445 12th Street, S.W. Suite 8C453 Washington, DC 20554
BY FACSIMILE, ELECTRONIC MAIL, AND POSTAL MAIL
Dear Chairman Powell:
I am writing to you today in regards to the digital television
Broadcast Flag; specifically, I write in response to Sen. Hollings'
and Representatives Dingell and Tauzin's letters of July 19, which
urged you to mandate the Broadcast Flag proposal outlined in the
final report of the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a donor-supported
non-profit organization that works to uphold civil liberties
interests in technology policy and law. EFF has played a critical
role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the
Internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction
on strong cryptography exports; securing the legal principle that
Internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant;
and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests
against DMCA-related prosecution.
EFF was an active participant in the Broadcast Protection Discussion
Group. We attended the group's meetings and conference calls and
participated in the group's policy and technical mailing-lists. EFF
also maintains a web-site that was and is the only public source of
information on the Broadcast Flag negotiations and proposal. The
site can be found at http://bpdg.blogs.eff.org. EFF devoted
thousands of staff-hours to publicizing the existence and nature of
the BPDG to the public, to civil liberties and consumer-advocacy
groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose
products were threatened by the proceedings.
When you and I met at Esther Dyson's PC Forum last March, we spoke
briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined
by the Broadcast Protection Discussion Group's mandate. The BPDG
proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free
expression, competition and consumer interests. Worst of all, it
will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the DTV transition,
compromising DTV adoption itself.
As you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured
those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often
in spite of the misgivings of rights-holders. From the piano roll to
the PVR, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever
products they believe the public will pay for; what's more,
innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest
regulatory hurdles. NTSC tuners and devices are governed by precious
few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products
that interact with them, from the VCR Plus to tuner-cards for PCs to
the PVR. The Broadcast Flag proposal would limit technologists to
shipping those products that met with the approval of MPAA member
companies. No entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori,
whether his innovative DTV product will be legal in the market until
he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to
the Hollywood studios for review.
Consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the ""Open
Source"" or ""Free Software"" movement, in which technologies are
distributed in a form that encourages end-user modification. From
server-software like the web-wide success-story apache, to operating
systems like GNU/Linux, to consumer applications like the Mozilla
browser, Free Software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer
benefit and commercial activity. The BPDG proposal implicitly bans
Free Software DTV applications -- such as the DScaler de-interlacer
and the GNU Radio software-defined radio program -- as these
applications are built to be modified by end-users, something that
is banned under the BPDG proposal. The tamper-resistance component
of the BPDG's ""Robustness Requirements"" will create and entire class
of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional First
Amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive
speech in code form under one of several Free Software/Open Source
licenses.
The BPDG nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright
line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability
when deploying their products. However, the end product of the BPDG
was a ""standard"" that contained no objective criteria for legal
technology; rather, the standard required that new technologies be
approved by MPAA member companies. Not uncoincidentally, the only
technologies that were approved by the MPAA -- and hence the only
legal technologies -- were those produced by the 4C and 5C
consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the MPAA's
allies throughout the BPDG process. This is an harbinger of the sort
of regime that the BPDG standard will usher in: technology companies
will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by
allying themselves with Hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain
technologies and outlaw others.
The marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently
producing products that increase the value and desirability of new
technologies, such as DTV. A BPDG mandate would subvert the market
for DTV innovation. Competing companies with lower-cost DTV
technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to
market if they failed to assuage the MPAA's concerns about
unauthorized redistribution. Furthermore, the universe of
unauthorized-but-lawful uses for DTV programming will be shrunk down
to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. The ability
of the public to make unauthorized-but-lawful uses of television
programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of
broadcast programming, from the VCR to the PVR.
Ironically, the inevitable damage that a Broadcast Flag mandate
would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only
slow down DTV adoption, by driving up the cost of DTV devices while
reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would
create. If the public is offered less functionality for more money,
they will not flock to DTV.
The most disheartening thing about the Broadcast Flag is that there
is neither a strong case that the Broadcast Flag is a necessary tool
for protecting copyright, nor that the Broadcast Flag would be
effective in that role. The existing practice of Internet
infringement of broadcast programming -- analog captures from
devices that satisfy the requirements of the BPDG proposal -- would
not be stopped by the presence of a Broadcast Flag.
Higher-resolution DTV signals will likewise present no challenge to
determined infringers, who can capture full-quality analog signal
from DTV devices and then re-digitize them, suffering only a single
generation's worth of loss-of-quality before the programming enters
the Internet.
Meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a Broadcast Flag -- that
infringement will undermine Hollywood's business to the point that
movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value
of DTV -- is no more than superstition. No credible study or
analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to
Congress, the FCC, the CPTWG or the BPDG supporting this notion. The
public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright; industry
is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of
entertainers; the US government is being asked to mandate
extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion
technology sector -- all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few
studio executives.
EFF welcomes the FCC's oversight of the Broadcast Flag issue. The
BPDG proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a
looking-glass ""public process"" where only those participants the
organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence,
where the co-chairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit
the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology
companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly
for their products, where the press was banned.
The FCC has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public
opinion in its proceedings. As the FCC considers the Broadcast Flag,
EFF hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the
BPDG in light of the concerns raised by Microsoft, Philips, Sharp,
Thomson, and Zenith, as well as non-profit organizations including
EFF, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the Free
Software Foundation, Public Knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the
Center for Democracy in Technology, and the Computer and
Communications Industry Association.
Thank you for attention in this matter. Please let me know if we can
be of any further assistance to you.
Sincerely yours,
Cory Doctorow for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

* Update on Intel Corp. v. Hamidi
Intel Corp. v. Hamidi is now on appeal to the California Supreme
Court. EFF filed an amicus brief in support of Ken Hamidi on Aug. 6,
2002. The facts are simple: Over about two years, Hamidi on six
occasions sent e-mail critical of Intel's employment practices to
between 8,000 and 35,000 Intel employees. Intel demanded that Hamidi
stop, but he refused. Intel obtained an injunction barring Hamidi
from e-mailing Intel employees at their Intel e-mail addresses,
based on the common-law tort of ""trespass to chattels."" (""Chattel""
is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to
property in land.)
EFF's amicus brief argues three main points.
(1) Intel did not qualify for relief under ""trespass to chattels""
because Intel's e-mail servers were not themselves harmed by
Hamidi's e-mails. If Intel was harmed, it was because the content of
Hamidi's e-mails affected Intel employees, not because sending the
e-mails affected the functioning of Intel's servers.
(2) By focusing on unwanted ""contact"" with the chattel and ignoring
the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned ""trespass to
chattels"" into a doctrine that threatens common Internet activity
like search engines and linking. For example, if a website posted a
""no trespassing"" sign, any ""contact"" by a search engine could be
considered a trespass even if it caused no harm.
(3) The court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not
infringe Hamidi's freedom of speech. The First Amendment limits
private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel,
out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress
criticism. The same principle should apply here, where Intel's
claims of harm stem from the meaning of Hamidi's speech.

* DeCSS Author Johansen's Trial Rescheduled
The trial of Norwegian teen Jon Johansen, who created the
controversial DeCSS software, has been pushed back again. It is now
scheduled to be heard on December 9, 2002, in Oslo, Norway. In the
fall of 1999, Johansen and his team reverse-engineered the content
scrambling system (CSS) software used to encrypt DVDs in an effort
to build a DVD player for the Linux operating system. In January of
2002, the Norwegian Economic Crime Unit (OKOKRIM) charged Johansen
with a violation of Norwegian Criminal Code Section 145.2, which
outlaws breaking into a third-party's property in order to steal
data that one is not entitled to. This prosecution marks the first
time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his
own property (his own DVD). Johansen faces two years in prison if
convicted. The prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by
the Motion Picture Association.
The trial had originally been scheduled to take place in June of 
2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified 
judges to hear Johansen's case.  Now the case is scheduled to be 
heard by a three-judge panel. Help Jon in his battle against

* Bunnie Presents Paper on XBox Reverse Engineering
Paper Explains Flaw in Videogame Security System
Researcher Escapes Chilling Effect of Digital Copyright Law
Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory
For Immediate Release: Thursday, August 9, 2002
San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is pleased
to announce that former MIT doctoral student Andrew ""Bunnie"" Huang
will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the Microsoft
Xbox (TM) videogame system.
Huang will present his paper, ""Keeping Secrets in Hardware: the
Microsoft X-BOX Case Study,"" at 5:25 p.m. PDT on August 13, 2002, at
the 2002 Workshop on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems
(CHES 2002) in Redwood City, California (Aug. 13-15, 2002).
The Xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only
videogames authorized by Microsoft. Huang's paper ""shows how a
person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,""
said MIT Professor Hal Abelson, one of Huang's advisors. ""More
importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a
general design flaw shared by other high-profile security systems
such as the government's Clipper Chip and the movie industry's
Contents Scrambling System (CSS) for DVD players.""
Huang contacted EFF in March after his advisors told him that his
preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions.
With the help of Boston College law professor Joe Liu, EFF worked
with Huang, Abelson, and MIT administrators to analyze the legal
issues and draft letters notifying Microsoft of Huang's research
findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).
Microsoft told Huang and Abelson that while it might prefer that the
paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask MIT to
withhold the paper.
""Microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control
publication,"" said Abelson. ""Their response shows that they value
academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of
unfettered research and publication in advancing technology.""
Other companies have reacted otherwise, using the DMCA to threaten
researchers. The Recording Industry Association of America last year
warned Princeton Professor Edward Felten after his research team
exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. Last
month, Hewlett Packard (HP) threatened research collective SnoSoft
over exposing a security vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix operating
system. Soon after, HP clarified that it would not use the DMCA to
stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve
computer security.
Huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper,
""The DMCA clearly had a chilling effect on my work. I was afraid to
submit my research for peer review until after the EFF's efforts to
clear potential legal restraints.""
""Researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about
getting sued,"" said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Lee Tien.

* Baen Books expands fair-use-friendly e-book program
Baen Books will bind a CD-ROM into the October 2002 hardcover
edition of *War of Honor,* the latest volume in David Weber's epic
Honor Harrington space-opera. The CD will contain at least 22
complete novels, all in open formats like html and RTF, with the
fair-use-friendly admonishment ""This disk and its contents may be
copied and shared but NOT sold."" Included on the disk are the entire
Honor Harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the
Baen line, including Keith Laumer's *Retief!* and Larry Niven and
Jerry Pournelle's *Fallen Angels*.
Baen has been a banner-carrier for fair-use in electronic
publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a
multitude of devices. Other publishers have chosen to publish their
material in copy-controlled formats that make it impossible to
legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a
specific device, can't play on every operating system, and
occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screen-readers
employed by the blind.
Dmitry Skylarov, a Russian scientist, was arrested in July 2001, for
demonstrating how end-users could defeat the copy-prevention
employed by Adobe's e-book technology. Adobe asked the FBI to arrest
Skylarov for violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA),
which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing
copy-prevention technology. Though Skylarov was later released, his
employer, ElcomSoft, is still facing charges in the USA, and the
Russian government has issued an advisory warning Russian scientists
to steer clear of American technical conferences until the DMCA is
repealed.
Here is Baen's statement on the CD release:
You are about to start playing with a CD-ROM that has fairly
extraordinary content. As of this writing it includes twenty-two
UNENCRYPTED novels in several formats, the ten Honor Harrington
Novels, 3 Honor Harrington Anthologies and 9 novels by friends of
Honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.
(More than twenty novels for free, and with no stupid codes to work
around. Think of that.) The reason for the plethora of formats is to
try to please the people who want to read the novels on their Palm
Pilots or other text-specialized palm-sized devices.

CNET Software and Internet
Dear Readers,
If the best things in life are free, why does software cost so
much? Back in the day (that day being 1999, when the Internet was
the Next Big Thing), you could get almost all of your
software--e-mail, fax services, online desktops, you name it--for
free. Now, even
Yahoo
is charging for some of its formerly free mail services, including the ability to check your Yahoo mail from Outlook or another desktop e-mail client.
But if you look closely enough, you can still find some
worthwhile free apps. We've reviewed
four free e-mailers
to get you started. And we've also
taken a peek at the new
BearShare
, which is not only
free itself, but also lets you share music and media files at no
cost. Of course, whether you can find legal music to share is
another matter entirely.

Roundup: CNET reviews four free Web e-mailers
Yahoo now charges for services that were once free; Hotmail
   dumps accounts without so much as an explanation. So-called
   free Web-based e-mailers aren't quite as free-wheelin' as
   before. Are the savings worth the hassle? We take another
   look at so-called ""free"" e-mailers.
Get the gear you need to burn DVDs
DVD authoring is one of the hottest new hobbies around, but
   picking out the right equipment can be a daunting task.
   We've broken down the process and selected the best gear
   for the job, from camera to software, burner to DVD player.
BearShare 4.0
The latest version of this oft-overlooked Gnutella client
   lets you pay $19.95 for ad-free file sharing and offers a
   nice, clean interface and a chat client to boot. Plus,
   BearShare lets you opt out of bundled adware and spyware
   when you install it. Should you run to this app like a bear
   to honey? Not yet. We'll tell you why.

Import Hotmail addresses to Outlook?
I'm running Windows 98. Everytime I try to download files
from the Internet, QuickTime tries to upgrade, stopping the
download cold. I tried to remove the software, but it won't
let me. Can you help? I would like to use Windows Media
Player instead. --Wicked
Based on your desription, we're guessing that QuickTime pops
   up when you try to stream a media file (video, audio, or MP3s)
   from the Web. If so, this probably means that you have
   QuickTime set as your default media player for all media
   files. And since your version of QuickTime is out-of-date,
   whenever it launches, it attmepts to upgrade. You could simply
   upgrade the program, or you can to turn off the autoupgrade
   feature. In QuickTime 5.0, open the program, select Edit >
   Preferences > QuickTime Preferences. Uncheck the box labeled
   ""Check for updates automatically.""
If, however, you simply prefer to use Windows Media Player,
   open that program, click Tools > Options. Select the Formats
   tab, then check the boxes next to all of the file types that
   you want Windows Media Player to open. To make sure that
   QuickTime doesn't override your WMP settings, uncheck those
   file types within QuickTime.

Why ""Eek""? :-)
If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
I assume that you won't %ghost or remove these and the modules.conf
change on uninstall, though.  So people who are installing this RPM and
are unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD,
non-DVD drive) that doesn't support DMA will be left with a system
without a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM.  And without
ever knowing what struck them.  You can't remove the DMA setting from
modules.conf either unless you're sure that ogle added it there and
nothing else needs it.
The /dev stuff isn't that dangerous, but the modules.conf change can
be.  That's why ""Eek"" :)
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/
A worthy goal...
My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.
How about splitting the creation of the symlinks and modules.conf
modifications into a separate RPM?

suitability. Some investments are considered too high risk for low wage
earners or individuals below a certain liquid net worth. Therefore we
have developed our FRG Investment Locator. Apart from individual
consultation, this will guide our investment experts in making a
proficient individual investment plan. We are always open to our
clients' suggestions on how to form their investment strategy. In
special cases, clients specify what needs to be part of their portfolio.
However, we are always here to ensure that the clients always get the
best financial planning, based on their needs, goals, desires and risk
tolerance.

2.  C and C++ forces the developer to solve problems such as memory
management over and over again.  IMHO, Java is superior because the problem
of programming in the future is not about 0's and 1's, making the compiler
2% faster, or making your code take 5% less memory... It's about design
patterns, architecture, high level stuff...
Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or
device drivers - C still rules the world.
3.  Java is not just a programming language! It's also a platform... There
is NOTHING like the standard API's in Java in C and C++.  Everyone defines
their own API's, people end up solving the same problems ten different ways
The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.
4.  If you have a program of any type of high complexity written in C, you
can't possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within
the same magnitude of cost as Java....
I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)
5.  Makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a
person... Java, IMHO, reduces the dependence of these entities on the
individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer Java as it is
to reverse engineer C (large applications).
No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's."" 
    ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" 
    
    For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
    action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""

"Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it 
read-only:

   * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to
     reboot, at least.
   * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software
     have to reboot, at least.
No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:
	# mount -o remount,rw /usr
This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.
Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

Rhapsody rules
I never thought I’d say it, but I’m changing my tune about subscription music services.
When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com’s
Rhapsody
, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I’m rethinking my stance.
Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you’ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can’t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at

Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:
""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.
""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.
""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.
""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.
""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.

Sharp's Zaurus PDA suffers security holes
Sharp's Linux-based, business-oriented Zaurus handheld suffers from security holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network, according to researchers at Syracuse University.
In an advisory posted Wednesday to a Syracuse University computer-science Web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in Sharp's Zaurus SL-5500 and Zaurus SL-5000D handhelds. The flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

Outlook plug-in could let the hackers in
A widely used plug-in for Microsoft's Outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.
Security company eEye Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. Network Associates released a patch for the problem Wednesday as well.

A group including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the Center for Democracy and Technology is urging ISPs to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called John Doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. The group has sent letters to more than 100 ISPs, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.

Looks great! One note: most ""image-only"" spam actually has some text (a few 
words at the top, a disclaimer at the end) so keep that in mind. The typical 
image spam that slips through SA seems to have a bit of text, one huge image, 
then a bit more.

Olen ajatellut pystyttää itselleni lokaalin apt-varaston, kun Suomesta ei

testing.
After each new package, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
testing/redhat testing
(for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for
exmple)
This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.
As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.

Five Music Concerns To Pay $143.1 Million In Price-Fixing Case
Reuters News Service ...
The companies, which didn't admit any wrongdoing, will pay $67.4
million in cash to compensate consumers who overpaid for CDs between
1995 and 2000. The companies also agreed to distribute $75.7 million
worth of CDs to public entities and nonprofit organizations throughout
the country.

It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost
is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people
streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage
the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.
The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.
Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title
(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there
are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in
for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get
all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and
nearly impossible...
We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -
which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have
serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people
webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play
on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to
those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it
is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(

I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score.  I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.
I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.
A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...
On Thu, 29 Aug 2002, Justin Mason wrote:
I don't see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin -- but I see Dan's
points.

  - high score: as far as I can see, that's because SpamAssassin is
    assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days, and the
    Habeas mark has to bring it down below that. :(   IMO we have to fix
    the high-scorers anyway -- no spam ever *needs* to score over 5 in our
    scoring system, 5 == tagged anyway.
This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.

But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that
frequently hit on newsletters. If any newsletters actually use the Habeas
mark, that will be one way to help.
Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle
spam. It seems that at some point they could drop the licensing fee to
$1 or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for
copyright infringement.
Sorry, that just can't work.
If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.
Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.
Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.
The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.
[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

I believe that's just a matter of string parsing. If someone were to fix
the openssh package, removing the explicit Requires:, I believe the
automagic binary handler would figure the right libraries to use and
install. I haven't met an openssh like that and in worst case I've had 3
different openssl libraries (WTF can't they just bump a major version if
it's incompatible?!?).
Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version of
openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat
package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your
problem.
What you need to know for openssl is :
0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0
0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1
0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2
Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on
those files and not on ""openssl = version"".

Secure and at ease
By Jack Mccarthy
August 30, 2002 1:01 pm PT
MAX LEVCHIN'S FASCINATION with encryption started when he was a teenager 
in Kiev, Ukraine, and continued as he immigrated to the United States 
where he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In 
late 1998, not two years out of college, he drew on his passion to 
co-found PayPal, the online payment system that has since attracted tens 
of millions of users and gained the reputation as the premier Internet 
transaction processor. Now online auction house eBay has acquired his 
company for a king's ransom.
Not bad for a 27-year-old kid from Ukraine.
A programmer since he was 10 years old, Levchin and his family moved to 
Chicago in 1991, and since then he has pursued security as if on a 
mission. He created a startup right out of college to build secure 
passwords for Palm Pilots. He met Peter Thiel, and the two founded 
PayPal to target online payment security. Thiel is now CEO of the 
company.
""This company was founded on the notion of security value,"" Levchin 
says. ""Peter Thiel and I shared that vision from the very beginning.""
Thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas Levchin remains 
focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good 
fortune.
""I explain [PayPal] as a security company posing as a transaction 
processor,"" Levchin says. ""We spend a lot of time designing security so 
it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. 
The trade-off is fundamental.""
Mountain View, Calif.-based PayPal allows businesses and consumers with 
e-mail addresses to send and receive payments via the Internet, 
accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. The 
service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and 
more than 3 million business accounts.
Most of PayPal's users are participants in online auctions, which led 
PayPal to be closely linked with eBay, the leading Web auction site. 
Although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two 
companies resulted July 8 in eBay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition 
of PayPal. The agreement is subject to regulatory review.
Levchin says he will stay at PayPal as it merges with eBay. ""There are 
areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore.""
Although security is a dominant feature for PayPal, the company's 
ability to carry out open communications among the millions of 
participants fits the growing Web services model, Levchin says.
""This is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to 
one another,"" he says. Levchin is a panelist at InfoWorld's 
Next-Generation Web Services II conference Sept. 20
PayPal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. And 
Levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on 
exploiting the system, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and analyst 
covering financial services at Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner.
""If they didn't have Max, they might have succumbed, because PayPal was 
susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and Max tightened them up,"" 
Litan says.
To combat criminals, Levchin established ""Igor,"" an antifraud program 
that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. Levchin 
says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes. ""The 
work I do is important to PayPal and to consumers in general because the 
work makes Internet shopping safe. It's the view that ecommerce has 
arrived.""",0,0

Brothel duty for Australian MP
A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to 
spend the day as a ""slave"" at one of Western Australia's most 
notorious brothels. 
Liberal Party member Barry Haase was ""won"" in a charity auction 
after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of 
Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. 
[...]
""I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what 
Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his 
political career to make informed decisions that he might not 
have been able to make before,"" Ms Kenworthy said. 
Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party 
seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. 
""You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant 
charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game,"" he said.",0,0

1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations

spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.

That's understandable.  HTML mail is the worst thing since female

When I went all ""Open Source"", I stopped using my old partioning app

Then ext3 came out and my old commercial partioning app is real old, so I
ask what OS software can non-destructively repartition a HD so I can put
/home on a seperate partition now?
Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to
use it.
>If you didn't put /home on a separate partition,

With winbloze 9x I used to deltree the winbloze dir and some ""Program
Files"" dirs, and install ""fresh"" instead of upgrade, while saving my
other data. Can this trick be used with this RH8 upgrade? Example rpm -e
everything so all packages are gone, hit ""reset"" button and boot to
redhat CDROM in admin (rescue?) mode, delete all those config files left,
like ""/etc/*"", then do an install BUT NOT FORMAT THAT SINGLE PARTITION
that I'm installing on. If I can hack the details, is this theory
accurate, or will RH want to destructively install and elimate all
existing files?
You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).

I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include ""a
healthy dose of opinion"", as well a broadening of coverage including
languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms
other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it
covered a wide variety of platforms).

Dear Readers,
On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with
one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape
browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN
8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with AOL? It just might.

First Take: MSN 8.0 Beta
Redmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months,
and now, the proof""s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on
the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better
than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL?
First Take: ICQ Lite Alpha
One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated
feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? We take an early look.

""Dot-com downturn linked to domestic violence""
Domestic-violence worker Kathy Black remembers watching the Nasdaq 
take a nastydive on MSNBC, in March 2000.
""I knew then that we would have a lot of work on our hands,"" Black said,
referring to the caseload at La Casa de las Madres, the city's largest
organization serving women and children affected by domestic violence.
She was right.
Calls to La Casa's crisis line increased by 33% in the last financial
year, and the service saw a 10 percent increase in the demand for

Black said the dot-com collapse and a growing awareness of La Casa's

Sure!  I think it's relevant, but maybe for another purpose.  Paul Svensson
is thinking harder about real people <wink> than the rest of us, and he may
be able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam.
For example, some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data
in real life use, and any sort of similarity score to a piece of known spam
may be an aid in finding and purging it.
OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/), which uses fuzzy checksums.
It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than
something any of us would throw together for personal use (no offense,
Skip!).  But I have no personal experience of it.

The virus load issue is orthogonal to the fact. Bzzt. Switch on your
brain, you both. I was mentioning that a subpopulation outside of the sex
industry is/used to be extremely promiscuous, about two orders of
magnitude higher than average.
two orders of magnitude higher than average isn't 3k, I don't think.  Why

They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some
time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not
everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood
appears to be. [Not that the Chinese are much better rights-wise, but
they've actually built roads and such, which led to the creation of
merchant classes and the like that never existed under the Tibetans.]

"I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.
A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.
It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 
BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks
Hi,
I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.
This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html
Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.
The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.
When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)
Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.
Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

***Updating Data Safely with A DataSet, by Alex Homer
OK, so we cant store all three values for a row (the current, original

Author Interviews
***With François Liger, Craig McQueen and Paul Wilton, authors of Visual
Basic .NET Text Manipulation Handbook.
[AP] What do you think this book brings to the Visual Basic .NET
developer, and so who do you think needs this book?
[CM] The book provides a quick easy reference for string programming
tasks. String manipulation is a large part of programming and it is
difficult to remember it all. Having an accessible reference assists in
finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that
is already in the platform. It's valuable for all .NET developers.
[PW] I think all VB.NET developers need this book. String handling and
regular expressions are not arcane topics for high-flying gurus - they are
the stuff of everyday programming! The regular expression chapters give a
great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. In addition the
regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight
in gold - certainly more readable than all the documentation I had to work
with when writing the book.
[AP] In two sentences, explain what strings are in .NET.

***With Tobin Titus, author of Visual Basic .NET Threading Handbook
In June, Wrox brought out a slim 260-page volume on threading in VB.NET.
There has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out
on what seems a straightforward topic. In this article we interview Tobin
Titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on
the book, as well getting his opinions on various programming-related
topics.
What is free threading? 
Free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an
application. While VB developers have been able to control some aspects of
threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those
threads in the manner that they desire. Free threading allows the
developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should
end, and what it should do while executing.

***C#Today Free Code Download
Due to customer feedback, C#Today have decided to try out something new
this week - we are making this week's code  download \ support material
available to all non-subscribers (providing they are a member of the Wrox
Developer Community, which is free to join).
This week's case study: Generating Design Patterns Using CodeDOM 
http://www.csharptoday.com/content/articles/20020722.asp?&tid026
The Code Document Model (CodeDOM), which provides the ability to generate
source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .NET
facility and has attracted much interest. Within Visual Studio .NET, a
complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the CodeModel
object, which allows programmatic access to hand-written code. Together
these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to
develop a VS.NET add-in to streamline the production of common designs in
code. This case study follows the development of such a tool, which
attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an
existing C# or VB.NET project.
***Get on the Fast Track to Success
If you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core
.NET Technologies as quickly as possible, the Fast Track series is for
you.
The Fast Track books complement our Beginning and Professional series by
providing concise guides to core topics. They deliver the essential facts
and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .NET. By
targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to
concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics.

Subject: Patch to complete a change...
I guess that most of us don't use ""link"" very often ... I noticed it
last week, but only got time to look and see why today.
I would like to use [Link] a lot more, but is it rather
inconvenient.
I have set my right mouse button to [Move] a message to another
folder, which works fine.
However, [Link] also uses the same destination folder as [Move], and
so if I want to use [Link] I first have to mark the destination
folder with a message-move, undo the move, then I can use the
[Link].  Very inconvenient.
Is there a better way for me to set this up so that [Link] works
with one or two simple clicks?
(In essence: is there a way to mark a destination folder for a
message link or move without actually doing a move or link, I
couldn't see anything obvious).

Alas, all 4 of the 0.99 clues there are HTML-related.
That begged to try it again but with Tokenize/retain_pure_html_tags false.
The random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here,
and I repaired the bug that dropped 1 ham and 1 spam on the floor, so this
isn't exactly a 1-change difference between runs.

Yay!  That may mean that HTML tags aren't really needed in my test data
provided it's trained on enough stuff.  Curiously, the sole false positive
here is the same as the sole false positive on the half&half run reported in
the preceding msg (I assume the Nigerian scam ""false positive"" just happened
to end up in the training data both times):

these.  ""Python"" appears in 5 of them ('http0:python' means that 'python'
was found in the 1st field of an embedded http:// URL).  Sticking a .gif or
a .jpg in  a URL both score as 0.99 spam clues.  Note the damning pattern of
capitalization in 'header:MiME-Version:1'!  This counting is case-sensitive,
and nobody ever would have guessed that MiME is more damning than SUBJECT or

Good to hear it's not just me.  Mind telling me how you set PERL5LIB
specificly? I've tried a few things (setenv in the shell, as well as
$PERL5LIB == ...inside the Makefile.PL, even on the perl command
line..) with no success.

- Presuming your run Bash  :
Note the directory lists 
#  perl -e 'map { print ""$_\n"" } @INC'
Then set up the Shell variable PERL5LIB variable (and put it in some .bashrc 
for future use)
# export PERL5LIB=""directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4""
Then try to install the software
PERL5LIB is explained perlrun(1) : do 
# man perlrun for more information

"Related anecdote:
I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.
He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.
I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.
Anecdote number two:
In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.
I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who
wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a
mail order bride.
I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much
as anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.",0,0

"SF Weekly:
Nothing's more enticing than an evening cruise around San Francisco Bay, 
and the islands, bridges, and lights of the city are especially entrancing 
viewed from this vintage brigantine schooner. Built in 1933 and recently 
restored to its former glory, the 78-foot Rendezvous looks like a clipper 
ship out of the Gold Rush era, with its 80-foot masts and square-rigged 
sails.
That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.
If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs
another coat, and asks what you're using on it,
propose on the spot.

Defrosting the past
Ancient human and animal remains are melting out of glaciers, a bounty
of a warming world
BY ALEX MARKELS
As he hiked near Colorado's Continental Divide in the summer of 2001, Ed
Knapp noticed a strange shape jutting from a melting ice field at 13,000
feet. ""It looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and
amateur archaeologist recalls. ""I thought, 'That's strange. Bison don't
live this high up.' ""
Knapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,
where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a
bison–one that died about 340 years ago. ""This was an extraordinary
discovery,"" says Russ Graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it
could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""There's
probably a lot more like it yet to be found.""
And not just bison. Colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and
snowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru
to Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and
industry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. As
the ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is
emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep
freeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky
fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our
predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.
""It's mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through
studying these remains,"" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude
archaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic
Society. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered
in the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old ""Ice
Man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have
offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as
the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional
treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.
Vanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother
Nature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can
deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they're
often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them
don't even realize they're ancient.
That was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in
British Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a
dead animal. ""It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,""
recalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. ""But when I looked
closer I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.""
Figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur
trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc
bag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed
the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what
seemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter
lived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi, or Long Ago
Person Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who
may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human
from the period ever found in North America.
Other findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could
explain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the
first place. ""Before this there was no archaeological record of people
living here,"" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. ""Now we
see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities.""
Like Ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek
caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,
Gerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south
Yukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in
caribou dung. ""It was really odd, because I knew there hadn't been
caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls Kuzyk, then a
wildlife biologist with the Yukon government.
Caribou cake. Returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a
pencil with string wrapped around it."" It turned out to be a
4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the
ice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer
cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800
years of changing hunting practices.
Scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the
ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.
Hunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded
some equipment in the ice. ""We've got people hunting with throwing darts
up until 1,200 years ago,"" says Hare, who now oversees the research
project. ""Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about
1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing
darts.""
Now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They
are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where
glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to
have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska's Wrangell
and St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States' most glaciated
terrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing
European Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as
the Ice Man. ""Global warming is providing us high-altitude
archaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We're

"FROM: DR. BEN KOKORI
Compliments of the season.  I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in this letter.  Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost confidentiality, as this is required for its success. 
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 2002. The source of the funds is as follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The present civilian government set up the contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants !
and members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;  (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for us (the panel officials   (iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, Companys name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the account number into which  the funds should be paid. The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my direct Telephone number 234 1775 5791 and my America Internet Fax number 240 744 0416 or 801 516 7986 only.
It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I hear from you.
Best regards,
BEN KOKORI",1,1

Dear Readers,
Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs
doing
something about it
. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru,
show you how

Is your ISP safe from hackers?
Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard
about security issues, but should you count on their skills to
ward off intruders? Not wise, says our ISP expert. In this
week""s column, Dan Tynan takes security matters into his own
hands and shows you how to protect yourself.

"Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:
1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.
Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.
I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).
Is there standard ""out of the box"" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).
Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ? 
Thanks,

I don't usually spend much time explaining metaphors. They are, after all, 
metaphorical. They can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. Written 
well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. But, I'll 
depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a 
recent metaphor.
I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at 
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, 
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of 
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open 
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.
Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), 
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even 
PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the 
Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.
So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only 
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition 
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the 
course of a year talking about what's
wrong
with our system than what's 
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be 
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or 
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would 
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of 
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect 
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual 
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from
outside
the US 
disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would 
be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being 
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of 
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to 
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of 
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.
The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In 
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the 
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion 
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held 
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the 
metaphor in a perfect way.
Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure 
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just 
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will 
remain mercifully nameless:
We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!
Followed by:
... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who 
would be able to replace him.
... and, in a later note on the topic ...
Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.
Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.
Chris
has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial 
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no 
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill 
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has 
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans 
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes 
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.
So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to 
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.
Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye 
out.

Win Apps in Linux?
Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by
CodeWeavers
- CrossOver 
Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've 
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll 
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the 
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task 
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few 
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. 
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.
A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the 
leading corporate backer of the
Wine Project
. Wine has been, for the past several years, an 
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but 
it's also one that's been undertaken by
others
in the past year or so. Though the progress has been 
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development 
realm.
CrossOver 
Plugin
marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its 
release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications 
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of 
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide 
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system 
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called 
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on 
creating Linux functionality with
one
related set of Windows 
applications: browser plugins.
The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a 
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 
6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser 
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web 
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need 
covered.
But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package 
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several 
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications 
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.
Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install 
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with 
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped 
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want 
these apps to work.
The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from 
the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin 
and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin 
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the 
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my 
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight 
- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for 
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped 
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed 
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the 
CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get 
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, 
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. 
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, 
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the 
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins 
directories.
The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these 
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin 
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black 
II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.
I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax 
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the 
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to 
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within 
a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.
Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite 
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as 
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much 
faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, 
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty 
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.
I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. 
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.
Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the 
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the 
backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, 
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications 
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if 
I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better 
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I 
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.
Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IX
We're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to 
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration 
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and 
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear 
decision as to how to configure each section.
Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you 
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either 
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.
Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. 
But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds 
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the 
telescope cameras were attached to this port.
Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for 
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or 
Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will 
work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer 
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the 
BIOS.
Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

Date: Not supplied
The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 
    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro
NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.
Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.
In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.
That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.
Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.
The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.
His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.
No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.
The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.
When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.
Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.
But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an 
advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro, 
the former Republican National Committee deputy chief of staff, is 
founder and president of a political e-marketing firm. This was written 
for the Los Angeles Times.

Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.
Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year. CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.
With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.
Motorola Sees Profit Rebound
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.
Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.
The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.
MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27%
Apple meets lowered expectations
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billion
Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.
APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49%
HP, EMC storage systems to work better together

"I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).
Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.
My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.
The article makes four main points.
1) Absence of critical clauses. 
In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.
2) Specification in English only.
That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.
3) Arbitary licence change.
The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.
{
David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.
Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*
That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).
}
4) Hidden defects.
Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.
{
Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.
Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.
I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).
Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. 
See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.
The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.

5) Roughly.
There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.
-----  Whole Article. -----------
Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.
Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.
Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.
Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.
Absence of critical clauses.
The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).
The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).
Specification in the English language.
Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. 
The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 
Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.
A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.
Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.
In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 
The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".
An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 
For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.
You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.
You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. 
Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 
The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.
The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)
This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. 
This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.
LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". 
OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.
Roughly Speaking.
Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. 
During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. 
In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.
The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

[2] Une telle clause de contrat 
qui est opposée à ce que dit la Loi 
française est qualifiée en terme 
juridique de « clause réputée 
non-écrite », c'est-à-dire 
qu'on fait comme si cette clause 
n'était pas écrite dans le contrat. 
C'est pour cela par exemple que vous 
pouvez signer un bail pour un 
appartement qui stipule que 
les enfants sont interdits dans 
l'immeuble, et envisager sans 
inquiétude d'avoir quand même 
un enfant, en effet le code civil 
stipule que le devoir d'un locataire

Dear Sir, 
REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP 
Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. 
Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. However, with my being in direct charge of
Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late
Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. 
Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- 
(a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang 
(b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. 
For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. 
Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship.

.1. Sponsorship, How and Why? Veuve Clicquot Speaks 
    Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10, 
2002
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex, 
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy. 
 
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the 
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the 
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer - 
known locally as The English Season. 
Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our 
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these 
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport. 
  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication 
tool?
Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the 
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where 
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We 
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time. 
  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?
We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of 
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and 
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and 
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to 
make The Season central to our marketing mix. 
  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?
We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our 
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the 
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and 
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever 
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.
We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions 
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office will 
like to be involved in such a decision. 
  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?
Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment 
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events. 
This is our rule and frame of investment.
  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?
Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis--
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press, 
magazine of all kinds). 
Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that 
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of 
similar status, but differing interests. 
  Please describe one of your sponsorships
The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdray 
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by 
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve 
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target 
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the 
king of sports.
  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?
Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large 
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we 
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve 
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are 
getting a good return on our investment.
  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?",1,1

taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.
....
To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.
--------
I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.
One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 
Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 
A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. 
But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. 
Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2
Folks,
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.
Thanks a lot,
Peter

We All
Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today's Society.
Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed.
Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:
Monday:
The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do?
Tuesday:
The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""What now,"" you think to yourself.
Wednesday:
You've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?
Thursday:
Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven't a clue how to handle
    it.
Friday:
Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?
And what about all the other things:
Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified?
Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair?
Lost a Security Deposit?
Bought a Home or Purchased A Car?
Signed an Employment Contract?
Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
Had Trouble With Your Credit Report?
Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute?
Been Involved in a separation or divorce?
Had to Collect Child Support?
Prepared A Will or Wanted To?
In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.
Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
but it provides it 24 hours a day
, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
and it is for a small monthly fee
. No Kidding.
Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

I'm gonna fix this one. I think the best solution will be to copy the modified 
rules to blib and install them from there. Then the rules files will be 
changed on build time and not install time, too.

The other thing on my todo list (probably tonight's tram ride home) is
to add all headers from non-text parts of multipart messages. If nothing
else, it'll pick up most virus email real quick.
See the checkin comments for timtest.py last night.  Adding this code gave a
major reduction in the false negative rate:
def crack_content_xyz(msg):
    x = msg.get_type()
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-type:' + x.lower()
    x = msg.get_param('type')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-type/type:' + x.lower()
    for x in msg.get_charsets(None):
        if x is not None:
            yield 'charset:' + x.lower()
    x = msg.get('content-disposition')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-disposition:' + x.lower()
    fname = msg.get_filename()
    if fname is not None:
        for x in fname.lower().split('/'):
            for y in x.split('.'):
                yield 'filename:' + y
    x = msg.get('content-transfer-encoding:')
    if x is not None:
        yield 'content-transfer-encoding:' + x.lower()
...
    t = ''
    for x in msg.walk():
        for w in crack_content_xyz(x):
            yield t + w
        t = '>'
I *suspect* most of that stuff didn't make any difference, but I put it all
in as one blob so don't know which parts did and didn't help.",0,0

Are you using the same version of GCC to compile the plugin as its C++
dependencies?
Yes, I am.  Everything is built inside a chroot.  I think it isn't linking 
to a lib somewhere, I'm just not sure what lib it should preloading here.  
Anyway to find out which one it is ?

means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting
the music playing.
By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.
The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.
For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.
The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
CD.
Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.
What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.

The two problems I see with filtering that early are:
    1. Everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham to the
       stew, making the Bayesian classification less effective.
    2. Given that there will be some false positives, you absolutely have to
       put the mail somewhere.  You can't simply delete it.  (I also don't
       like the TMDA-ish business of replying with a msg that says, ""here's
       what you do to really get your message to me.""  That puts an extra
       burden on my correspondents.)  As an individual, I would prefer you
       put spammish messages somewhere where I can review them, not an
       anonymous sysadmin who I might not trust with my personal email

I personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level.  Bandwidth
is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time.

"If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.
I think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct
spelling is important.  Would be interesting to see if this same effect is
applicable to written forms of other languages, maybe even Japanese romongi.

"OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.
This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.
Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:
a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 
All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 
So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.
The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.
Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!
If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!
Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youll know if its right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.

REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!",1,1

I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.
Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.
So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:
class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):
    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }
    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)
This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.
It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).
One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:
Dear Sir/Madam,

May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student

"This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere.
I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).
bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.
As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.
But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?
Thanks,

Disney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
with Iraq could really kill 'em: 
    While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
    steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
    record profit for Disney year after year. 
    ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" 
    said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding 
    growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""... 
    Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
    $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
    2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
    whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

It'd be an MP3 player with solid state storage... instant on.
Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. 
Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.
You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".
Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.

If you want to do http, C gets pretty muddy (curl is about the best
choice I've found) but I grant you that: No language is the be-all and
end-all.
I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for
24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of
code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to
maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  
As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much as
I've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've never
ever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be
responsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am
so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.
Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been
using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found
any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in
the task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by no
means perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party
libs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really
hate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.
For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll
together a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a
stream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational
databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an
XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where
can I find C libs for those components?  
On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket
which can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically
refresh themselves over socket connections to the relational database,
presenting the retreived values through XSLT-defined transforms, and
again, where can I find such stuff for C ... or for any other langauge
but Java?  Wombat (servlet spec for Perl) was inviting, but it's not
ready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C
is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.
When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?
Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do
you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and
trying it out?
In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see the
social infrastructure for either happening during my professional
lifetime.

Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET
BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
bar is pitch black.
The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.
Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.
""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.
In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.
""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.
""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.
Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.
An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.
And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
actually been eating.",0,0

ps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the
""colours from the ftoc"" stuff all deleted, and it is looking just about as
good as the old unseen window used to look.   I still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)
and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute
I'm just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping.  Once
its done, I'll send a patch for someone to look over.

Why?  What threat does Outlook pose to your organization?
It places the company, corporate network and data at risk.
Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more
being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places
other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company
reputation and liability with customers at risk, and
proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably
expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that
Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence
and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned.
Have you looked into using a custom sequences file?
More detail please?  I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their
use, but how can I make indices with them, and how can I keep them up
to date?
I don't use custom sequences, so I can't comment well.  I suspect that
you'd have to use a cron job to maintain the sequences.
The only thing I actually miss in that regard is support for S/MIME.
You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on a
very remote machine.  In this scenario, the mime handling is weak.
Nope.  I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis
SSH X11 forwarding).  In fact, your message was read and replied to
(this message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home
machine.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order

Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?
1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.
2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.
3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.
4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!
5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.
6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!
7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.
8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.
9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.
10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

Techs lose again with Seibel earnings miss, AOL questions
Siebel Systems fell short of Wall Street's earnings expectations and offered a worse-than-expected outlook, helping to depress technology shares Thursday.
Despite a forecast from IBM in line with analyst expectations, investors seemed more focused on reports of a possible management shake-up at AOL Time Warner and on a Washington Post story questioning accounting methods at America Online. CNET's Tech index shed 24.59 points, or 2.45 percent, to close at 982.84. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 40.30 points, or 2.88 percent, to close at 1,356.95.
Amid news The Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in June, broader markts also headed south. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. The S&P 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.
AOL used unconventional business practices-Post
America Online Inc. boosted its revenue figures through unconventional deals from 2000 to 2002, before and after its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., the Washington Post reported on Thursday.
A chart printed in conjunction with the Post article shows a total of $270.1 million in unconventional deals.

IBM posts sharp drop in quarterly profits
International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday said it eked out a second-quarter profit of just a few pennies a share as the world's largest computer maker took a $1.4 billion charge to exit money-losing businesses and cut jobs.
But even without the big charge, earnings at IBM, which sells everything from computer software to microchips to computer services, fell sharply as corporations concerned about their own bottom lines cut back on technology spending.

Nokia sees slight rise in Q3 handset sales vs Q2
Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia said on Thursday it expected a slight rise in handset unit sales for both itself and the industry in the third quarter versus the April-June period.
""it will be a reasonable quarter, but it will not represent such a dramatic growth as what might have been seen in some previous years,"" Chief Executive Jorma Ollila told a conference call following the firm's second-quarter result.

J.P. Morgan stays cautious toward Qwest in tech notes 7/18/02
Analyst Marc Crossman repeats a ""market performer"" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of Qwest's local and long-distance businesses. Crossman says Qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. And he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.

Dell: PC Market Slow and May Stay So
The stumbling economy continues to dampen demand for personal computers and could do so for the rest of the year, Dell Computer Corp. Chief Operating Officer Kevin Rollins said on Thursday.
Despite the slow market, No. 2 computer maker Dell is gaining market share, partly because of the recent merger of Hewlett Packard Co. and Compaq Computer Corp., Rollins told reporters after Dell's annual shareholder meeting here.

FYI, I'll never trust such a scheme:  I have no tolerance for false

TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under

tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.
Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good

Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

ALB> Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
ALB> By Andrew Marshall
ALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.
ALB> ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
ALB> knew then there was something special.""
ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
ALB> who is expecting their first child.
ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
ALB> in search of a wife.
ALB> ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""
ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
ALB> the couple married.
ALB> MR. MARRIAGE
ALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
ALB> agency.
ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.
ALB> ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.""
ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.
ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
ALB> language problems.
ALB> ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
ALB> Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""
ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
ALB> client has found a potential wife.
ALB> ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
ALB> think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
ALB> usually within the next year.
ALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
ALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
ALB> than 10 percent have broken up.
ALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.
ALB> ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.""'
ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
ALB> stress disorder.
ALB> WHY?
ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.
ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
ALB> no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
ALB> need Wan,"" he said.
ALB> ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
ALB> their future husband.""
ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
ALB> choose to use his agency.
ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
ALB> singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
ALB> not ""God's gift to women.""
ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.
ALB> ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
ALB> Impossible,"" she said.
ALB> ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ALB> ladies from other countries.""
ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
ALB> not a major obstacle.
ALB> ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
ALB> a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
ALB> very quickly.""
ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
ALB> to the West.
ALB> ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.""
ALB> PITFALLS
ALB> But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.
ALB> ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
ALB> spoke to me.""
ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
ALB> there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""
ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.
ALB> ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
ALB> comers.""
ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
ALB> looking for a foreign husband.
ALB> ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
ALB> Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide.
It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing
package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigures his package.
Case of headers is definitely helpful.  SpamAssassin has a rule for it
-- if you have headers like ""DATE"" or ""SUBJECT"", you get a few more

I have seen documentation out there for procmail, but is there similar

Separately, it looks like many people use spamassassin with razor.  If I

''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program
and if people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are bound
to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. DUE
TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS
PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY   WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable
opportunity"". I was approached many times before but each time I
passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one
could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $ 610,470.00 in 21 weeks,
with money still coming in''. Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""this program has been around for a long time but I
never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in
the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to
come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months
after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8
months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00
and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is
to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.'' More
testimonials later but first:

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months
easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT
AGAIN and AGAIN !!!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS
WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT
YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name
appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN
ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail
problems.

===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5
REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your
computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5
reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your
computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case
something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way
other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or
you will loose out on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not
work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and
if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put
their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get
all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some
have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try
to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you
do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the
reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and
you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.

1. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting
their fortune.

2. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.

3. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.

4. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.

5. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2

6. Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This
is critical to YOUR success.

==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data.
To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more.
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:



 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it
goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive
only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much
better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000
each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000
e-mails.

With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.
Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a
total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded
with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.


Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for
Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for
Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is
100,000 orders for Report # 5.

THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million
dollars).

Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 +
3..... $5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand
Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST
POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen
if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000 e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people
on the Internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more
coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just
that, and more!

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads
on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go
along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them
the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders.

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name
and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise
until they receive the report.

===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or
somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or
credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is
simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send
$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted.
Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2
sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the
NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL
ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within
2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did
not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

**Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in
front of a Different report.

You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME
SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this
business !!! =================================================

FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: 
You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for
the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF
EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS
INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly
well as it is now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have
put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2
....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to
may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on
every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the
more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have
given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to
become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !

=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============

'' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am
an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty
good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving ''junk mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting
my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I
''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told
you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was
on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the
next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all
cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
 Mitchell  Wolf C.P.A., Chicago, Illinois
=================================================


'' Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make
up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am,
I decided that the initial investment was so little that there
was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back''. '' I was surprised when I found my medium size
post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the
first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does
not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better
investment with a faster return and so big''.  Dan Sondstrom,
Alberta, Canada 
=================================================
'' I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made
more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within
22 weeks''. Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
'' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money
with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions
carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My
first month I made $ 20, 560.00 and by the end of third month my
total cash count was $ 362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to
internet''. Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.
And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the
fact they were hired in the first place?
BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market
there were also gains to society from irrational behavior.
If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their
chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for
society.  On the social level, the law of averages works to societies
benefit in a manner it can't for an individual.
A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England
was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own
good.
(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals
and railroads over here.  Thanks, guys.)

eventually be used for pennies on the dollar, the benefits to society

   Yeah, but I try to 'take it easy' on your server.  The golden rule of the internet: when you find a free resource, don't piss'em off!  :)  I really appreciate your work; you get done the things I wish I could, and I respect that.
Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I
wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is
entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/
    OK, I'll search for the ISOs on the  one remaining site that isn't hammered.  :)
Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(
    Sure: this is a linking issue, right?  Right now I'm still pure-vanilla.  I have the stock version of rpm/rpmlib/popt/etc and the recommended version of apt that you gave me.  No, wait...there's no new code getting loaded.  I don't know, either.  It's been a long day.

Why ""search""? There's more than enough to choose from here :

   The hunt continues- with a new field!  (Actually I checked there yesterday, but it's worth another shot.)

The reason I ask is that I have seen performance and also some feature
differences (fullscreen w/o keeping aspect ratio, visual artifacts on NVIDIA)
comparing with or without the Win32 codecs. The mplayer authors seem to
recommend using them for x86 architectures.

Beware, I am no mplayer/codecs/whatever expert, I may be totally lost ...

This is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! 
    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution. 
    Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells. 
    ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.

Tech stocks drop again on Qwest criminal probe news
Word telecom Qwest Communications International is being investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office in Denver helped send technology shares lower Wednesday.
Despite a Merrill Lynch upgrade of Cisco Systems and the fact that J.P. Morgan began coverage on AOL Time Warner with a ""buy"" rating, CNET's Tech index fell 26.23 points, or 2.66 percent, to 965.29. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index lost 35.11 points, or 2.54 percent, to 1,346.01--a multi-year low.
Broader markets also shed value, dragged down in part by a troubled pharmaceutical sector. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 282.5 points, or 3.11 percent, to 8,813.5, and the S&P 500 slid 32.36 points, or 3.52 percent, to 920.47--also a multi-year low.
AT&T, Comcast Shareholders OK Broadband Deal
Shareholders of AT&T Corp. and Comcast Corp. on Wednesday approved the planned $27 billion merger of AT&T Broadband with Comcast, which will create the nation's largest cable TV operator with more than 22 million customers.
Telephone giant AT&T in December agreed to sell its cable television unit to Comcast as part of a restructuring that dismantled its vision of becoming a one-stop shop for telephone, data and video services.
AT&T CORP 9.78 -2.30%
$215 million later, start-up Pluris shuts down
Networking start-up Pluris will release a statement Wednesday announcing it has closed its doors because of a lack of funding and ongoing woes in the market it serves, according to a spokeswoman familiar with the company's plans.
Pluris, a once promising company, burned through $215 million over the past few years as it attempted to build a high-end router that was intended to outclass similar products from competitors such as Juniper Networks and Cisco Systems.
CISCO SYSTEMS 13.51 2.82%
WorldCom contracts under U.S. scrutiny
The accounting scandal at WorldCom has prompted U.S. government agencies to scrutinize the telecommunications company's billions of dollars in federal contracts.
The Federal Aviation Administration, for one, has been forced to take stock of the situation quickly. WorldCom is a finalist for a 20-year, $3.5 billion contract with the FAA. The contract is expected to be awarded as soon as this week. The company is the incumbent on the contract, which supplies phone and data infrastructure to the nation's air traffic control systems.
WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.20 -3.81%

Banc of America Securities lowers estimates and price target on IBM in notes 7/10/02
Analyst Joel Wagonfeld argues the computer giant is not immune to the persistent, widespread weakness in IT spending. But a roughly 6 percent dip in revenues during the second quarter will be offset by the elimination of losses from the discontinued hard disk drive business, Wagonfeld predicts. In IBM's second-quarter results, he expects continued weakness in hardware but relative strength in software and outsourcing. The company's decision to exit or restructure unprofitable, commodity businesses is sound, Wagonfeld says. He reiterates a ""buy"" rating on IBM.

Is Maximum System Performance and Reliablilty Important to you?
Find out what you are missing!
New Diskeeper Lite for Windows.
IT'S FREE!
* Includes the same advanced defragmentation technology used in
  Diskeeper 7.0.
* Is much faster than the previous Diskeeper Lite and all
  built-in defragmenters.
* Now runs on Windows NT®/98/2000/XP.
Millions of downloads attest to the popularity of Diskeeper Lite,
but it only ran on Windows NT 4.0. Now it's been updated for all
Windows operating systems from Windows 98 onward.
New Diskeeper Lite is still manual-only and cannot be scheduled
or run across a network, but it is far superior to any built-in
defragmenter and much faster. And it will show you why full-version
Diskeeper is the most recommended automatic defragmenter ever
built.

I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never
been so easy! ;-)
I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably 6 months or more, so I
could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.
What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.
The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.
And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.
Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.

"Jeff--
What is the maildrop recipe you use with spamassassin?  I was trying to
set mine up but I am running into a few difficulties.
I think I will try spamassassin first and see how it goes, and then
perhaps fold in razor2... is it easy to fold in?
Sunil
Here is my recipe for Maildrop:
# Vipul's Razor check
#
log `/usr/bin/razor-check`
log ""razor-check = $RETURNCODE""
if ( $RETURNCODE == 0 )
{
  xfilter ""reformail -a'X-Razor: SPAM'""
  log ""SPAM caught by Vipul's Razor""
  to ""$FOLDERS/.SPAM/""
}
I used this with Razor version 1.  I'm not sure if it was ever used with
Razor2.  I am now using SpamAssassin w/ Razor2.  You may wish to remove
the log statements once running.
I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.
There were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it
alone. After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2
does a very good job.
HTH,
  Jeffrey
Quoting Sunil William Savkar <sunil@inthespace.com>:
Hi.
I just finished installing and getting running maildrop with my
virtual users.  I was thinking to set up razor with maildrop as my
first test of its filtering capabilities..
I have seen documentation out there for procmail, but is there similar
documentation for integrating maildrop with razor?
Separately, it looks like many people use spamassassin with razor.  If
I am using razor2, is there still an advantage to this?
Thanks in advance.
Sunil

When the Intel Pentium 4 2,8GHz CPU arrived to our testlab we ordered 10 
liters of Liquid Nitrogen (LN2 -196°C) and decided to run some tests in 
very low temperatures.
After some adjusting and testing we were able to run SiSoft Sandra CPU 
and Memory benchmarks and Pifast benchmark smoothly when the CPU was 
running at 3917MHz. We raised the FSB one more step and managed to run 
succesfully SuperPi benchmark while CPU was running at 3998MHz. The 
result was 39 seconds.
Test setup: P4 2,8GHz, Modified Asus P4T533-C, Samsung PC800 RDRAM, PNY

"Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.
http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html
There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html
""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.
All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.
But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.
It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.
But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. """,0,0

In my experience, there are spam messages that sneak past Spam Assassin,
that Razor will pick up. Those are the ones that I'm calling ""marginal"".
Basically, I'm hoping that ""the collective"" of Razor users make a better
judge of spam than any single program like SA can, and therefore I can
benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering. I've
seen examples of this already, where SA doesn't score the spam high enough
to bounce it, but Razor does.
I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  If
you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this
in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.
  score RAZOR_CHECK 10
The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.
Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA
then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5
would be sufficient.
If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.
Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once
for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor
individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA
won't do it and avoid the double network hit.
However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has
been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The
current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.
But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.
Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
of use as Razor1.

"Following further study, I've concluded:
   1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.
   2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.
   3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text.
Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. 
  Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a 
sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, 
well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with 
and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear.
Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", 
shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode 
interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with 
the bytecode interpreter enabled.
When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several 
rendering anomalies appear:
   - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more
     compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".
   - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,
     causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the
     same problem.
   - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient
     whitespace between them.
   - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.
   - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled
     with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode
     interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop.
Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. 
It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of 
making a mess of antialiased rendering.
This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, 
I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode 
interpreter turned *off*.",0,0

"[Neale Pickett]
I hacked up something to turn WordInfo into a tuple before pickling,
That's what WordInfo.__getstate__ does.
and then turn the tuple back into WordInfo right after unpickling.
Likewise for WordInfo.__setstate__.
Without this hack, my database was 21549056 bytes.  After, it's 9945088
bytes.
That's a 50% savings, not a bad optimization.
I'm not sure what you're doing, but suspect you're storing individual
WordInfo pickles.  If so, most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to
that, and doesn't happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance
directly.
So my question is, would it be too painful to ditch WordInfo in favor of
a straight out tuple?  (Or list if you'd rather, although making it a
tuple has the nice side-effect of forcing you to play nice with my
DBDict class).
I hope doing this sort of optimization isn't too far distant from the
goal of this project, even though README.txt says it is :)

WordInfo).

I'm not interested in optimizing anything yet, and get many benefits from
the *ease* of working with utterly vanilla Python instance objects.  Lots of
code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes.  Very few
people have tried this code yet, and there are still many questions about it

IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GOT THIS MESSAGE: Please see the

- --------------------------------------------------------------
* Progress of Senate anti-spam bill
Over a year ago, Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT) introduced S.630, the CAN
SPAM Act of 2001. This bill would require UCE to have a valid return
address to facilitate consumers' removal from spam lists. It would
place enforcement in the hands of the Federal Trade Commission, and
state Attorneys General. It would also permit Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) to enforce violations, up to $10 per illegal spam.
It would preempt any stricter state anti-spam laws.
The Senate Commerce Committee considered the bill on May 17th, and
reported it out largely unchanged.  It's not now scheduled for further
action in the Senate.
CAUCE has always opposed this bill, since we believe it would lead to
more spam, not less.  When South Korea passed a similar opt-out law
last year, spam from Korea soon increased by a factor of 10.
Our April 2001 press release goes into more detail about the problems
with S.630:
 http://www.cauce.org/pressreleases/pr-s630.shtml
We're pleased that the Congress is looking at spam issues again, and
hope that in the future we can help them create an effective bill that
the entire Internet community can support.

* European Union bans spam
GLOBAL INTERNET COMMUNITY APPLAUDS EUROPEAN ANTI-SPAM VOTE
May 31, 2002 - The Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail
(CAUCE), EuroCAUCE, CAUCE India, CAUCE Canada and the Coalition Against
Unsolicited Bulk E-Mail, Australia (CAUBE.au) today applauded the decision
by the European Parliament to protect European Internet users from the
practice of unsolicited e-mail advertisements. Yesterday's vote will turn
Europe into a virtual ""spam-free zone"" after the formal adoption of the
directive, making it illegal to send unsolicited e-mail, text message or
other similar advertisements to individuals with whom companies do not
have a preexisting business relationship.
""This is a tremendous day for European Internet users,"" said EuroCAUCE
Chairman George Mills. ""We are extremely pleased that the European
Parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added
the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the
privacy of Europeans.""
While six European Union member countries had already formalized ""opt-in""
in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all
of Europe into a spam-free zone by the end of 2003.
""Unfortunately, the rest of the world's Internet-using countries,
including the United States, now lag behind Europe in their protection
of Internet users,"" said CAUCE Chairman Scott Hazen Mueller. ""This is
a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow
Europe's lead and unite behind protection of Internet users and
network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited e-mail
advertising.""
""This decision is the direct result of Internet users throughout the
European Union standing up for their rights, and Members of the
European Parliament listening to their constituents,"" said Mills. ""Our
members and our volunteers performed an integral part of this process,
translating, lobbying and educating their representatives.""

Parliament's Web site <http://www.europarl.eu.int/press/index_en.htm>,

"Hijacker High (8/30) 
Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer, Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.

Great article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use. 
    For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population. 
    The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.

provides a
DNS based whitelist.
There's a practical reason for that:  Any DNS list (white or 
black) works
only for a limited number of IPs; the set of unlisted IPs is 
much larger
than the set in the DNS list.  If you have to make a binary decision to
accept or reject, you'll be wrong less often if you reject the 
blacklist
and accept everything else, rather than accept the whitelist and reject
everything else.
A whitelist is only helpful when (a) you only want mail from a limited
number of known sources, or (b) you can use a secondary system 
like SA to
decide what to do with the vast unlisted masses.  Most MTAs still make
only the binary decision, because the secondary computation is 
expensive.
With SA's cooperation, though, it might be worth a try.  Even better if
one could get commercial anti-spam outfits to agree to factor it in.

"Back when I had regular RH7.3 there was nothing better than ""apt-get upgrade"". But
now I'm running (null) beta and I have these questions:
which version of ""apt"" can I use, the RH7.3 version or the ""rawhide"" version?
Is there a way to use apt to update (null) with the rpms available for (null)
through up2date, since I prefer apt to that?
If I can use apt, can I use it to get updates from these 3 different places:
1. the (null) up2date Redhat upgrades
2. the (null) files at Freshrpms.net
3. the regular RH7.3 files from freshrpms.net
Am I asking for too much simplicity in this complicated world?

"Hello -
You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?
Enough.
If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.
This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.
How much are we making?  Anywhere from $500 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.
This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).
Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.
To grab a FREE ID#, simply reply to: sj95@yahoo.com
and in the body of the email, write this phrase:
 
""Tim, enter my name for a free membership.""
Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)
We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.
That's all there's to it.
We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Sincerely, 
Tim Hopkins
P.S. After having several negative experiences with network
marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...
and finally make real money on the internet.
Don't pass this up..you can sign up and test-drive the
program for FREE.  All you need to do is get your free
membership.
Unsubscribing: Send a blank email to: sj95@yahoo.com with
""Remove"" in the subject line.  By submitting a request for a FREE
DHS Club Membership, I agree to accept email from the DHS Club for

OpenTextの伊東です。お世話になっております。
[Service for UNIX] のご質問として、新しいチケット番号で取り扱わせて
いただきます。サポートのマネージャに確認を取りましたが、現在までに
[Service for UNIX]を使用されているという例は聞いたことがありません。
問題なく動作するかどうかは疑問があるそうです。サポートされていない
環境ですし、実際利用しているというお客様も、0だということです。
（少なくともサポートのほうに報告されている中では、ですが・・・）
何か、[Service for UNIX]が原因では、と考えられることでもあったので
しょうか？もし、三菱化学様で、サポートされている範囲でプロセスダウン
が起こるかテストを行えるようでしたら、確認してみていただけますでしょう
か？できるだけ排除できる要因は切り離していただきたく思います。
（その節は、今までのプロセスダウンのチケット、53121OTC1のほうで
対応いたします。）
よろしくお願い致します。

Hmmm.   How about you create empty Data/Ham/Set[12345], stuff all your
files into a Data/Ham/reservoir folder, then run the rebal.py script to
randomly parcel messages out to the various real directories?
I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.
An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.
I suspect you can pull the same stunt for your Data/Spam stuff.

I.
 From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.
Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).
Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.

Being that I have a print subscription to PocketPC Magazine, 
I haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when 
Hal Goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery 
method that they've employed, I felt obligated to give it a 
spin. You can check out the September 2002 Issue of the
Digital 
Edition
and see if you like reading the mag in that 
format better than the print variety. A Software and 
Accessories Encyclopedia is also new to the site since my 
last belated visit.
I've also been using my PocketPC quite a bit lately, but 
not for data. It's found a more frequent home on my belt as 
an MP3 player ever since Diana's dad gave us a bicycle. 
Going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and 
it's nice to bring along some tunes. I've tried both the 
Compaq iPaq 3870 and HP Jornada 565, and have been more 
pleased with the audio ability of the iPaq, due in part to 
the sound utility Compaq provides to adjust treble and bass 
levels. It's just a more full-sounding device, in my 
opinion.
See You in

LDAP Whodunit
Pondered by Warren Dugas
""Randy, a little question for you: Do you know what LDAP is and how important it is to the world of technology? I'm sure you do - but where did it come from? Hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. Did Microsoft create it? Hmm - No, how about Novell? Nope. Well, who then?""
History of LDAP
http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winntas/evaluate/featfunc/ldapcmr.asp
X.500, the OSI directory standard, defines a 
comprehensive Directory Service, including an information 
model, namespace, functional model, and authentication 
framework. X.500 also defines the Directory Access Protocol 
(DAP) used by clients to access the directory. DAP is a full 
OSI protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of 
which is not used by most applications.
DAP is significantly more complicated than the more 
prevalent TCP/IP stack implementations and requires more 
code and computing horsepower to run. The size and 
complexity of DAP makes it difficult to run on thin clients, 
such as the PC and Macintosh where TCP/IP functionality 
often comes with the machine. DAP stack implementations are 
cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of 
X.500. Hence in 1993, the folks at University of Michigan, 
with help from the ISODE Consortium, designed and developed 
a protocol that would work over TCP/IP and was small enough 
when implemented to run on a thin client like PC's running 
the Windows operating system or the Macintosh.
The LDAP version 1 Specification was published in March 
of 1994. The LDAP version 2 Specification was published as 
rfc 1777 by the Access Searching and Indexing of Directories 
(ASID) working group in the IETF in March of 1995. In April 
of 1996, 40 companies including Microsoft, Netscape, and 
Novell separately announced support for LDAP protocol in 
their Directory Services products in order that they may in 
turn operate with each other and integrate with the 
Internet. LDAP version 3.0 has gone through several drafts 
but at this time is not finished.

Looking for Sound
Suggested by Corey Hollett
http://www.turtlebeach.com/site/products/santacruz/whatdoineed.asp
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/reviews/earlyimpressions/ProMedia51.html
""I've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best 
sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. My 
criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd 
playback. A price under $500.00 was also a strong 
point.""
Corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two 
respects. Creative has long maintained a healthy share of 
the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. 
Audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as Turtle 
Beach and Philips, which also produce quality sound cards 
and at attractive price points. Corey decided on the Turtle 
Beach Santa Cruz card, a great choice.
His choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings 
on the subject. I own two Klipsch speaker sets, the ProMedia 
2.400 and most recently the ProMedia 5.1. The 2.400 system 
was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me 
when I say that the ProMedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the 
dust. The above review that Corey pointed out hits the high 
points, and is actually quite in-depth for an ""initial"" 
review. I'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a 
more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

QuickTime 6 Released
http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/
With the debut of QuickTime 6, we can assume that the 
licensing haggles over MPEG-4 have been resolved, making way 
for the long-awaited release. MPEG-4 isn't the only 
addition, joining a new AAC audio codec that is a favorite 
among professionals. Streaming media skip protection, Flash 
5 support and better AppleScript functionality also tag 
along. As always, there is a standard free version available 
for download, but the Pro edition adds additional features, 
such as full screen video playback, the ability to create 
MPEG-4 content and editing features not present in the free 
player.

Microtel & WalMart Love Linux
http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26192.html
WalMart is selling Microtel PCs, but with a slight twist. 
They were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall 
LindowsOS and offer systems to the retail market through 
WalMart.com, and now Mandrake is being offered as a pre-
installed choice in operating systems. These options give 
potential Linux users an easier way to get started without 
having to build their own system from scratch or deal with 
driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. A 
Pentium 4 2GHz system with a CD-RW drive goes for as little 
as $648 with Mandrake Linux, so not too shabby at all.

Close encounter of burnt kind
IT came from outer space ­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation ­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed ­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added.

NTT DoCoMo have released a paper on the use of human flesh as a networking 
medium: 
    A device attached to a PDA can send and receive weak electrical signals 
    through people, with human bodies as communications circuits, the paper 
    said, citing sources close to the companies. 
    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical 
    connection to a PDA that can remain in one's pocket, the paper said. 
    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers 
    while shaking hands, with the data automatically written into both their 
    PDAs, the paper said.

Rastafari.
That is, if you concede that of the two founding branches, only the
one founded by the Nyabingi were legit and the others were
thinly-veneered anti-colonial hooligans.  
There is also Vietnamese Buddhism, unless you count setting fire to
oneself as a ""foul action"".
What about Tibetan Buddhism BTW?  They seem like an awfully nice bunch
of chaps (and chapesses).
When we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we
noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.

The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.

(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)
Man, I'm not going *there* again ;)  I'll agree, though, that the ideology
or practices of the religions have very little to do with the conflict.
The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that

The WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless, 
ranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose 
hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible 
reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, 
but the prices and network can't be beat. 
    T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the 
    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta 
    Jones. 
    The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche 
    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 
    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the 
    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate 
    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. 
    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average 
    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents 
    per minute.)

No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. 
My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 
Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. 
For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.

"REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 
Dear Sir,
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. 
We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. 
Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Dr. Osaro Ame, a director general in the
Ministry of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man
tender board appointed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria to award contracts to
individuals and companies and to approve such contract
payments in the Ministry of Mines and Power. The
duties of the committee also include evaluation,
vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign
and local contractors in the ministry.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 
The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 
However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 
The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.
We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service
code of conduct, does not allow us to operate
off-shore accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction is highly needed . 
My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not
want to miss this once in a life time opportunity.
You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 
(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 
(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 
(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 
(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 
Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1-443-658-2542 or my email
address and I will bring you into the complete picture
of this transaction when I have heard from you. 
Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 
Thank you and God bless. 
Yours faithfully, 
Dr. Osaro Ame

"Once upon a time, Ben wrote :
I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my 
kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec 
that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that 
freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, 
including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will 
consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.
Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/
What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".
Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.
I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.

For your kind attention,
              REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.  However,I am in search of a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle a confidential transaction of this nature.
I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.
Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.
Yours Faithfully
BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.

Yeesh.  Sounds like what you need is something to kick up once and score

Wait a second...  So *that's* why you wanted -u.

If you can spare the memory, you might get better performance in this
case using the pickle store, since it only has to go to disk once (but
boy, does it ever go to disk!)  I can't think of anything obvious to

Should be fixed : You probably had libdv-devel installed and MPlayer
automatically detected it. The new spec file explicitely passes
--disable-libdv when the package is rebuilt with --without libdv.
Grab the ""fr2.1"" spec from here :

The new spec didn't even want to build the package
something with config.mak
Also this new spec looks like the old one, it got libdv and libdv-devel

  | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
  | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
  | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
  | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
  | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.
I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.
The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).
Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.
That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.
Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).
kre
ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates.

"In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.
Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.
Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

Bob,
This guy's an idiot.
I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864
of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules
each.  They weigh 125 kg.
You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked
maximizes that.
It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking
and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need
voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual
capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them
arranged in series to boost the voltage.
Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time.

Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,
called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
a vacuum.
Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like
1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible
to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for
accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.
(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)
Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few
real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were
talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the
wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,
it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady
discharge curve.
But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not
the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those
you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole
atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with
a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,
and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.

Adios to options excess?
If the nation's politicians expect Silicon Valley to fall in line on the issue of expensing stock options, they're living in a fantasy world.
Flipping through my Rolodex this past week, I couldn't find one solitary technology type willing to support even the mildest proposal to change how corporations account for stock options. The more common response was a verbal ""middle finger"" shouted in the general direction of Washington.
No surprises, there. The options argument is not just about putting food on the table--make that
a lot
of food, in some cases--but about the way the computer industry views itself. Tech companies believe they belong in a different category, say, from the likes of Coca Cola, Washington Post Co. and Bank One Corp.--all which recently decided to begin expensing stock options.
Tech titans also served notice they will remember to support friends--and shun foes--in Washington next November. An empty threat? Perhaps, but consider this: in the last national election, the computer industry contributed more than $40 million (52 percent to Democrats, 46 percent to Republicans.) That was good for a seventh place
ranking
, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Charlie Cooper
, Executive Editor/Commentary
Why the options party is over
Transamerica Investment Management portfolio manager
Kenneth Broad
says
it's easy to see why the tech industry is fighting so hard to keep options from
being expensed: no one likes to lose a free lunch.

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>
*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*
A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.
The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.
Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.
If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.
Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.
Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.
""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""
Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""
Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.
""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.
Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.
Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.
Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""
""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.
A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""
Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca

"ATTN:MANAGER
HELLO DEAR,
I am well confidence of your capability to assist me
in
a transaction for mutual benefit for both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish on you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.
Well, I am BELLO SANKOH, Son to MR FODAY SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars cash). This money was made from the
sell of
Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.
Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Côte d'Ivoire.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Côte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:
(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another nearby country where taxation will not
take great toll on the money?
(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?
(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
will be invested?
Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.
For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount ( 22 million dollars ) at the end of this
business. The security of this business is very
important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential.
I shall expect your urgent reply.
My telephone number is 22507625348.
Thank you and God bless you
BELLO SANKOH Tel :22507625348

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV

""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,

lately I've got the feeling that exmh is getting slower and slower. I 
just decided to check that vs. reality, and yes, speed has left the 
scene somewhere between the release of 2.5 and now.

I checked on a number of small messages in a big folder (~10000 
msgs). The delay of the Next button has increased considerably:

2.5-release: 350-450 msec
latest cvs: 1000-12000 msec

Frankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the 
user settings hasn't changed.

Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?
Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.
I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on Friday, 
and have plenty of ""real work"" to do, I won't be able to do much until I get 
back.
I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check into 
what's slow and fix things while I'm gone, my feelings won't be hurt.

changed on build time and not install time, too.

 The wheel is already patented in Australia; Melbourne man patents the wheel:

 The sad news is that there seems to be a lot of patents (pending or not)
that's for very basic/general ideas; it's the current form of ""domainnapping"",
and it might turn uggly when people start trying to enfoce these patents.

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of

I started wondering how does apt react when it finds a newer kernel in the

Look at /etc/apt/apt.conf. I think ^kernel$ matches the kernel packages
(apart from those matched by the rest, smp, enterprise).
I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the
abovementioned might have nothing to do with it.
I explicitly use apt-get install kernel and then from the list pick a
version and then install kernel#2.4.foo-bar.
And has anyone ever tried to do a dist-upgrade, say from 7.1 to 7.2? 
Should it work? If not, why?
Should. Haven't tried with dist-upgrade but I have put 7.2 netboot
mirror (ie, 7.2) into sources.list and run install step-by-step for IIRC
everything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth
checking such as, especially, passwd and group.

Woah ;) did you tweak some flags yourself, like default rpm flags ? What 
dist are you running ? I don't think there's an athalon-redhat-linux 
machine as standard ;) it should be some permutation of athlon and linux, 
and without redhat, but I can't tell for sure.   Any idea where your 
system might be setting this flag ?

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.
Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.",0,0

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.
If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.
Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
blame law school and my cat.

Anyone know why Red Hat insist on sticking with python 1.5.2?
They want to preserve binary compatibility for all .x releases. Red Hat

At the 1993 ITAC ""Roadwork"" Conference, Peter Mansbridge asked the

of the panelists laughed except Bill Buxton.  Peter asked him if he
knew something the others didn't.  Bill replied that it /was/ possible
to censor the internet, which drew a gasp from the audience. ""All you

I know you want to look at pussy, but first you need to learn
The Truth about the adult industry:
Get Into Paysite Free!
If you take 2 minutes to read what I have to say you will have full access
to some of the largest membership sites for free.
TRUTH
A recent internet survey showed that almost 28 % of all the revenue generated on the internet today is from adult products & websites. Making it the #1 product/service in demand on the internet.
TRUTH
Yahoo conducted a adult internet survey that showed more than More than half of all adult surfers have paid up to $50 for a pay site membership. We wonder why? It is really easy to ge
t into these sites for free. Why would you pay for a membership to an adult site with out knowing what they really have to offer? It's kind of like going on a blind date, you don't really know what to expect! I have top a adult sites you can become a member to for FREE.
TRUTH
These directions are common sense, but some people still haven't figured it out! I have found a pay site offering free passes. So if you get a free pass imagine all the movies you can download onto your hard drive. All %100 free. These sites all have more movies, chat rooms, and hot pictures than any other porn sites I have come across to date. They are all A+ porno sites.
All %100 free.
DIRECTIONS
Follow these 6 simple steps and you'll get a free pass into an adult paysite. Note that these passes are not permanent, but they're free and it takes less than two minutes to get in.
STEP 1:
Scroll down the page & click on the Web site banner below that interests you most.&nb
sp;The descriptions and the links are below. Pick the one you want to get your 1st free pass to.
STEP 2:
Once you arrive at the site you have selected, fill out the form, then click the submit button that says ""GIVE MY FREE PASS"". Remember to wait several seconds for the entire page to load. If you are on a dial up modem it will take a minute to process the page.
STEP 3:
This will take you to the second join page. Fill in the required information. This is not some second rate site run by couple scumbags, these are multi-million dollar operations with policies and rules. They won't charge you for the free pass. Don't believe me? Read their Terms and Conditions.
STEP 4:
After you have filled out the rest of the form........click the SUBMIT button! Only hit it one time! Wait one or two minutes, it will send the username and password to your e-mail account. That's it, within minutes you will have a free pass
STEP 5:
That's i
t! That's all there is to it. Like I said before read the terms and conditions for yourself so you feel comfortable with it .This method of getting a free pass is best described as cutting out the middle man.

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.
 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.
 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

"JUST as the pyramids of Egypt were built in honour of great kings, it was
fitting that sandy replicas were created on Weymouth beach in memory of the
king of the castle. Fred Darrington, who became the world's most famous
sand
sculptor, died last week aged 91. His grandson, Mark Anderson, who has
taken
over his Dorset seafront pitch, is determined that his grandfather's name
will
not be forgotten, despite the impermanence of his creations.
Can someone please tell me what a ""pitch"" constitutes? I have an idea 
it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim, but this sounds 
more formal.
------------------
Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his
sculptures.
Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.

There are two open alternatives that I can think of
that don't appear to have been mentioned 
elsewhere in this thread.


One is Firebird (this is my personal favourite).
It is http://FirebirdSQL.org and you can
purchase support contracts here
www.ibphoenix.com.
Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.
It's really amazing to think how much they've got
out of a db that is only 4 MB in size - that's 10
times smaller than the Oracle *_client_*.


Having said all of the above, Oracle is really
a super product, but ya pays ya money...

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single
developer license downloadable from their website.

From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting
(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have ""something
roughly equivalent"" (ie ""it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime"") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.
If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on ""who can I work with"" and only
maybe 10% on ""how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?""

Maxtor Driving Capacity-Centric Enterprise Apps With ""Super-Sized"" ATA Drives
Maxtor Continues its Leadership in the Market it Pioneered with a New 
Category of High-Density ATA Drives
MILPITAS, Calif., September 9, 2002-
Maxtor Corporation (NYSE: MXO), a worldwide leader in hard disk drives and 
data storage solutions, today announced Maxtor MaXLineTM, its newest 
generation of ATA drives designed specifically for rapidly emerging 
enterprise storage applications including near-line, media storage and 
network storage. The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: 
huge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; 
and unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to 
failure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.
The MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into ""near-line"" 
archive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive 
architectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including 
executive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be 
recovered on demand.
These new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the 
storage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, 
these files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced 
starting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor's MaXLine family offers 
high capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between 
traditional ATA and SCSI drives.
For system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, 
easy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server 
environments.
""The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies 
are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, 
financial documents and transaction records,"" said Mike Dooley, senior 
director of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. ""Users may 
not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but 
when they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA 
technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our 
legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA 
hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these 
enterprise applications.""
The MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for 
capacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for 
capacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage 
density than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been 
tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, 
already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, 
which exceed MTTF of over one million hours. These drives will also carry a 
three-year warranty.
The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II feature the Maxtor Fast DriveTM 
UltraATA/133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 MB per second. 
The MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus II will be available with next-generation 
serial ATA interface for higher performance. At 150 MB per second maximum 
data transfer rate, serial ATA improves hard drive performance to keep pace 
with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive 
environments and enterprise applications.
With a point-to-point connection architecture, and rich command set for 
managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ATA 
advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. 
The interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn 
allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with 
increased design flexibility and hot plug capability.
""Maxtor's MaXLine family of drives provide a solution for storing data that 
has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said Dave Reinsel, 
analyst at IDC. ""The ATA drives offer a great value, low cost per GB and 
when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling 
cost-effective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have 
been the traditional solutions used for near-line applications.""
Availability
Limited qualification units of the parallel ATA versions of Maxtor MaXLine 
II and MaXLine Plus II are now available; with volume units available in 
the fourth quarter. Qualification units of the MaXLine II and MaXLine Plus 
II with serial ATA will be available later this month with volume shipments 
scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003.

"OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.
This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.
Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:
a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 
All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 
So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.
The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.
Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!
If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You dont need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!
Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youll know if its right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.

REWARDS, by calling us at 1-720-733-7315 today!",1,1

help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for

Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it

Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have 
resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented, 
dysfunctional kids ..
Don't swallow too quickly what you have read about
more traditional cultures, today or in the past. Do
we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from
centuries past? Are you so sure that the kids in 18th
century England were any more ""functional"" than those
today? What about 20th century Saudi Arabia?
At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and 
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.
Granting your first two points, I'm skeptical about
the last. Do you see ANY signs that America specifically
or the west generally are suffering from lack of
innovation, vis-a-vis youth nations such as Iran? The
last I read, the third generation of the revolution all
(a) want to move to America, and (b) failing that, are
importing everything they can American.

Hi,

In my build scripts, I have problems with some of the kernel packages.

For kernel-sources, I get :

Package kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3

on running apt-get install kernel-source

Now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
Second, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is 
done from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.
That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.
'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

"XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.
Some notes from other places....
From Doom9 [3]
""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
been resolved XviD development will not continue.
That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
and kept quiet about the matter at hand.
[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
might be hearing more about this.
[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
compatible as it was advertised.
[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
copyright notices which is quite funny.""

I dunno, BB.  Women who like to be thought of this way should have the
right to choose to be treated this way.  Men too...  ahem.  (:  My boy
cleans, washes clothes, cooks, fixes stuff, etc, and works the same number
of hours I do, sometimes more, if he has to catch up with me.  (:  I
close him because he is industrious and creative, and because he
unfailingly makes my bed the minute I get out of it.  And boy #2 will be
here soon to help boy #1 with other things such as pedicures,  backrubs,
and sure, fucking.  LOL! (along with the aforementioned ""chores"") Adam can
have his cake and eat it too, if he can only find the right girl who has
the same beliefs about gender  roles that he has. Of course, he has NO
clue where to look, so we will be constantly laughing at him while he
stumbles around in the dark.

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special ""build"" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:
	the-app 2>&1 | grep dude
Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.
Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

 Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?"" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."" 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at £7.99

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most

"I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:
Application       What gets pasted
XEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten
The last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).
It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??

"This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
me!
Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.
From the spamc man page:
       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.
The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:
       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.
I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

| Hi All,
|
| I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|
| When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
| gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or

If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the

Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As

"Gordon Mohr:
It was clear you were talking about averages. But it should 
be equally clear that that isn't what people mean when they
use the word ""promiscuity"". 
Sigh.
This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of
female monkeys with males other than the alpha male, i.e, specifically
not the tail end of the distribution.  ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs ensure [etc.]""
OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each
pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women
This has never happened.  Its relevance is nil.
Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.
So I chose not to type ""on average"" explicitly in my post, since this
is FoRK and one tends to assume that people have a clue.
There is no disagreement between us, except that I am more interested
in typical behaviour and you in extreme.  Actually, you probably just
had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it.
EOT, AFAIC.

First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.
This sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - I'm seeing flist
in general taking 5-10 seconds.  Interesting that a different wish comes up
fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4.
Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.
Hmm.. weirdness..
Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).
I've been seeing this as well - *usually* with inbox, but it's gotten
stuck on some other folders as well (I have procmail do rcvstore into folders
for me).

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance,
according to company officials.
Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used
on all transaction in order to process them... So this has some preaty heavy
implications, unless it's just BS.
Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best
alternative.
Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)
In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount
importance in the world of XML.
""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall.
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
Again, see above... they _are_ claiming to decode the crypto...
""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly,

I'm using Sendmail and running procmail on the gateway to call

I know it more of a sendmail question, but my google searches have only
turned up people trying to log all inbound and outbound email.

Using procmail, SpamAssassin doesn't get called for outgoing email
(messages sent to other machines). 
Procmail=Local Delivery Agent => inbound traffic to LOCAL machine.

Lockergnome's Guide to Converting Vinyl LPs to CD is no longer free. 
Over the last 10 days, almost 4,000 people downloaded the free tome. 
Of that 4,000, close to half put in a fake e-mail address, resulting 
in a ridiculous number of bounce messages in my inbox. Add to that 
the fact that several of the clever individuals used other people's 
real addresses, which then amounted to complaints of spam from the 
address owners. It's not worth providing a free service if it causes 
Lockergnome to be labeled a spammer as a result. The crowning gem was 
the in-duh-vidual who used the name A** Hole and Chris's personal 
address to download the PDF. On a more positive note, the guide is
now available in all six formats
,  
for the minimal price of $5, complete with some additional content 
based on a couple reader suggestions.
Chris may have an obsession with Peets coffee, but I'll bet he's never 
been the daily special. On my visit to St. Louis, for the
SIC
, I 
started every morning with a walk to the West Port Starbucks. 
Apparently my morning ritual was a source of entertainment for the 
employees, which evolved into discussions of a reality based TV show 
based on the concept of stalking me. I've even got the
incriminating evidence
to prove it.
The SIC provided me the opportunity to see some cool updates to a couple 
titles, in addition to being introduced to some useful audio oriented 
titles I'd never seen before. Expect a number of reviews over the next 
several weeks, as well as extensive coverage of last week's events in 
St. Louis in the annual SIC special issue. Lori managed to score a few 
more Gnomedex giveaways while we were in attendance, so those of you who 
sign up will be coming home with even more goodies, which, by the way, 
aren't of the stressball and pen variety -- we're talking software 
titles with reg codes.

Blending punk rock attitude with country twang makes for a fairly 
unique musical experience. I saw these guys play a show in Omaha, 
back in January of this year and was blown away by their stage 
presence. Rexway rip through an opening set with enough energy to 
kick-start even the most somber crowd, moving everyone in the 
audience to their feet and setting the scene for an entertaining 
evening. As with most punk, the lyrics are equal parts politics 
and angst, with enough colorful language to drop a jaw or two.

Croupier
(NR) 1998
Drama - 94min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)
Special DVD Features worth a look-Deleted scenes
In disembodied first person Clockwork style narration,  Croupier
pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers.
We know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the
games. Gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known,
however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier
(casino dealer).  Constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the
croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. Thus, the
cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others
lose. Jack Manfred (Clive Owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier
father (Nicholas Ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade.
Through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, Jack's
father also taught Jack that the only way to win is not to play. Punters
are sorry sods; the croupier is king. From father to son, the lesson
passes -- watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment
in life. Despite decades of croupier training, Jack is compelled to
write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape.
Jack's publisher regrettably relates to Jack that his novel idea is
trite; stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. When
Jack's father informs Jack of a casino opening in a small London Casino,
Jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing
the seedy underbelly of London's casinos. Unfortunately, Jack's ex-cop
girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing Jack for the
worst. In an attempt to fool himself, Jack creates alter ego ""Jake"" to
bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain Jack both morally and
physically unscathed. The absence of any clear delineation between the
personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (Alex Kingston)
approaches Jack with a scheme to rob the casino. Jack slowly comes to
the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino
or in life. You are either in the game, or you are not. Seasoned veteran
director Michael Hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle
talents of the ultra cool Clive Owen. Owen rules this drama, not with
flex and volume, but with glances and nods. Less is truly more, much
more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster
suspense films of recent memory. Croupier proves that it is not a large
budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre.

"The only circumstances in which a business will not be ready--indeed,
eager--to do an additional volume of business is if it is physically unable
to do so because it lacks the necessary physical means of doing so, or
because the costs it incurs in doing so exceed the additional sales revenue
it will receive.
That is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind
of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts.  There are a
bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of
California messed up and the energy producers exploited.
I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like
the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
necessarily the answer.
You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their 
jobs.
The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote
the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good

To: nettime-l@bbs.thing.net
From: Phil Duncan <PDuncan@AggregateStudio.com>
Subject: <nettime> The War Prayer
Sender: nettime-l-request@bbs.thing.net
Reply-To: Phil Duncan <PDuncan@AggregateStudio.com>
The following prayer is from a story by Mark Twain, and was quoted by Lewis
Laphan in the October issue of Harper's magazine. It occurs at the very end
of an excellent article which I recommend to you.
In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been
listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by young
patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays the
following:
""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our
shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their
patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of
their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with
a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows
with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little
children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and
hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of
winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of
the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their
hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their
steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood
of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the
Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that
are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.""
Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American
occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923,
thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it ""unsuitable""
for publication at the time it was written.

My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled

I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the

1. Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.
2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in
the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not
know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5
for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So
we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's
the problem!
3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.

"Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file
more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.
Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.

Do you really think this is true?  I added a modify time check thinking
that 
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times
in 
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of
cache 
when that happens anyway.

Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a 
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  My code is in proc
MhReadSeqs.

 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (£160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 ""I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money,"" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 ""I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then Im gone."" 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. ""It could end very soon,"" he said.

  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson 
  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.
  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.
  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 
  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 
  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.",0,0

"Anyone heard of this law before?
Q. Can I get a playlist?
A. We are unable to offer a playlist. The Digital Performance Right in 
Sound Recordings Act of 1995 passed by Congress prevents us from 
disclosing such information. The Digital Law states that if one is 
transmitting a digital signal, song information cannot be 
pre-announced. It is a Music Choice policy not to release a playlist of 
upcoming or previously played songs.
Recently, MusicChoice upgraded their website with a very important 
service, as far as I'm concerned: real-time song info from their 
website. My DirecTV receiver is up on a shelf (and its display scrolls 
intermittently); and I'm surely not going to fire up my projector while 
listening to the ""radio"", so I'm quite happy that I can retrieve r/t

Microsoft stresses security for Exchange
Microsoft is readying a new Exchange Server e-mail system, with improved security, a facelift for Outlook, and better support for cell phones and other handhelds. The upcoming version, the company's first major update of the product since releasing Exchange 2000 nearly two years ago, will by default
disable certain messaging features
to prevent hackers and virus makers from taking advantage of openings. While Microsoft's biggest nemesis in the e-mail and messaging market is
Lotus
, the company also competes against
Novell
and newcomer
Oracle
, which plans to release its own e-mail and messaging software later this year.

Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.
More details about these are at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/
None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.
POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.
It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.
Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.
In detail, he wrote:

Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
performance.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.
Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.

Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
polls them.
I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

Mac fans flocked to the Macworld Expo in New York to watch Apple Computer trot out new hardware, software and even a Web services plan--but it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.
Apple CEO Steve Jobs kicked off the trade show by
unveiling
new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
The new iPod players include models built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system. Apple lowered the price of the existing 5GB iPod and a redesigned 10GB model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. Jobs also introduced a beefier 20GB iPod for $499. The iPod stable now includes three models for Mac users and three models for Windows users with MusicMatch software.
As expected, Jobs introduced a new iMac model with a 17-inch flat-panel monitor. The model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolution versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch iMac.
Jobs also previewed the next version of Mac OS X, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves Aug. 24 for $129. OS X 10.2 includes a new Finder with improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds.
But fans who rushed to OS X last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will
not offer
a discounted upgrade version of Mac OS X version 10.2, code-named Jaguar, to current users of the operating system. To get Jaguar, current OS X users will have to buy a new Macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129.
Apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. Although the versions share the same core technology, Jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool Sherlock 3 and Internet address finder Rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.
Apple also raised eyebrows by
transitioning
its iTools Web services from a free program to a paid program called .Mac. The company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. The collection of Web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called iDisk, online greeting cards through iCards and other features.
Despite iTool's popularity, the company
may face a tough sell
with the .Mac program. The history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. Customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. Some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. In the early 1990s, Apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently.
To its advantage, Apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .Mac. And although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. However, an
online petition
protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program.
Microsoft's moves
Not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, Microsoft plans to
offer a rebate
for its Office suite for Mac OS X to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac. The promotion entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software.
The offers come after Microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. The software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of Office v. X by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last November.
Microsoft is also putting the
finishing touches
on the third collection of Windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. The update, Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that Microsoft released in February 2000. Service Pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads.
Not everything will be available as a download, however. Weeks before Microsoft plans to reinstate Java in Windows XP, it has
shut down
a site that would automatically send its Java software to Windows XP users. The company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told Java inventor Sun Microsystems it would reinstate Java in Windows XP through the forthcoming Service Pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.
Somebody's watching you
You better watch what you write in Yahoo's free e-mail service--because Yahoo is. To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to
swap out
a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.
""Mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from Web-enhanced e-mail. Typing ""mocha:"" into the location bar of the Netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. A malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge.
On the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's Web use, the U.S. government is again turning to technology to
monitor suspicious activity
in the name of fighting terrorism. The government has unveiled more details of its Terrorist Information and Prevention System (TIPS), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.
""The program will involve the millions of American workers who, in the daily course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual or suspicious activity in public places,"" according to the TIPS Web site. But the American Civil Liberties Union, one of several critics of the plan, fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possibly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.

Thanks Paul,
That is the way I am doing right now, but I would like to NOT use the mouse 
for such things. Any other clue?
The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being 
issued by exmh is that selects and inserts the sig and bind that to a 
key sequence.  That shouldn't be *too* difficult, it's just a matter 
of figuring out the tcl (something my perl-based brain isn't excited 
about :)

This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware 
Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.",0,0

Dear Readers,
One of the hot trends in notebooks is squeezing desktop processors,
not mobile CPUs, into laptops. Actually, the trend has been around
for a while, but the bigger vendors used to pooh-pooh these
efforts. (Intel was never too crazy about the idea, either.) Now,
it's a bona fide movement, and the latest 9.6-pound desktop-
replacement system from Toshiba takes this trend to new heights.
But questions abound: Are the extra pounds worth it? Do these 
things really get so hot that you can press pants with them?

I'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to
chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting
down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.
Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing
and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these
people.
question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way.
And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested
in stroking their pathetic egos?
OBTW, 'clueless social moron syndrom' does not have political boundaries.

Company Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.toteboard.net/Models/company_overview.htm
{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then ""forget
about it."" Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, ""E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information."" NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.
Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/
{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
""Shortcut to"" and ""Copy of"" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from ""Chris"" to
""Caspian Wildflowers""...)

Disk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html
{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
Unearthed by Michael Tretyakov
http://www.actualtools.com/
{Windows Explorer add-on} ""Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons."" This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the ""Stay On Top"" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
""important"" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The ""Minimize To Tray"" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you don't have to close down your programs to do
it.

Electricon Land
http://www.electriconland.com/
{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless!

GnomeTIP
I just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
""voicewarmup"" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the ""Temp"" directory and look for my log
files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with ""Msi"" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your
registry before making any modifications.

BTW, I think I'll kake it so that my ogle package automatically inserts
this ""options ide-cd dma=1"" to /etc/modules.conf! It currently creates the
/dev/dvd link to /dev/cdrom (which will work most of the time, if there's
only one drive) if no /dev/dvd exists.
Eek.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
Outputting a message in %post and providing a README of some kind would
be better, as well as perhaps adding a note in %description.

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""
Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 
Here is the bottom line ...
I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.
BONUS! Order now and get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush Views

Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01
The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

"Hello ~name~,
If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:
http://www.internationalfreecall.com
If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.
Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.
In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.
You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.
Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:
1-410-608-8178# 
Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!
Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.
If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier
This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.
2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.
3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.
4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.
5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.
6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.
7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.
8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.
9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.
10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.
Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. 
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

They're the ones I've selected for my life at

<br>help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear
<br>on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be
<br>moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
<br>which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
<br>have even more to appreciate.
<p>2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize
<br>how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it.
<br>EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly
<br>imagine.
<p>3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.
<p>4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and
<br>drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more
<br>calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.
<p>5. Read something educational, inspirational or
<br>entertaining--preferably all three.
<p>6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
<br>Super-conscious.
<p>7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.
<p>8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of
<br>my book, then write in my journal.
<p>9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful,
<br>magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.
<p>10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.
<p>Bonus Step: Make something work better --
<br>Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>No. This is a funny thing to me.&nbsp; I hear about so many
<br>people being super scared to give out their SS#.&nbsp; Well folks,
<br>I can get your SS# for 50 cents.&nbsp; Give me a name and address
<br>and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
<p>We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
<br>the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
<br>they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.&nbsp; They could do
<br>who knows what with the CC number.&nbsp; I once had a person
<br>tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
<br>of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
<br>person (me) would have her account info and could write
<br>a check out for thousands of dollars.&nbsp; I told her to just send
<br>it to me then and she said that was OK.&nbsp; Then I asked her
<br>to tell me what the difference was between the original check
<br>and a fax copy.&nbsp; I told her to ask her lawyer that too.&nbsp;
Never
<br>heard back from her.
<p>The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
<br>available in many places.&nbsp; Have a good day.

<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
<br>we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
<br>importantly, never give any personal information at a site
<br>that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
<br>or a Veri secure sign or others.
<p>Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
<br>in my credit information in each time instead of having
<br>an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
<br>involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
<br>mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
<br>deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
<br>to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00
Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. 
Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 
Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: 
- New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 
(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 
Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. 
- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. 
Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?

Slowing sales shrinking Intel workforce
Intel announced lower-than-expected earnings yesterday and that

outlook is not bright

Software contracts: Clause for alarm
In the high-stakes game of corporate software negotiations, the silver-tongued sales rep isn't your biggest challenge: It's 
the
language in the contracts
. Enterprise customers spend surprisingly little time pouring over the fine print of 
multi-million dollar software contracts that are rife with obscure terminology, vague expansion charges, and
mind-boggling 
license conversions
. As a result, they end up paying in ways they had never imagined long after the deal is signed. Just 
ask California.

Folks, the summers upon us here in the nations capital. And, matching the

mess. Lets hope they dont make it worse. Jennifer Hickey tells all in her 
revealing Washingtons Week piece http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html. 
And Zoli Simon has discovered that the Chinese have targeted Russian cruise 
missiles at U.S. ships. Read all about it

become a major force in time for the November elections? Hint  Its not the

CHINA ARMS FOR WAR
Zoli Simon writes that China's acquisition of cruise-missile weapons systems 
from Russia poses a clear and present danger to U.S. naval forces  and to the 
American homeland as well.

WASHINGTONS WEEK  ON THE LEGISLATIVE WARPATH
Jennifer Hickey tells us as investor anger registered more clearly with each 
downward tick of the stock markets, legislators engaged in an indelicate 
parliamentary exchange of whoops about arcane congressional rules while they 
danced and ululated to mutual charges of chicanery.
http://insightmag.com/news/258785.html

TAX CODE TRAUMA
John Berlau tells us that experts contend that simplifying the U.S. tax code 
would do more to cut down on corporate-accounting chicanery than the 
introduction of still more regulations and criminal penalties.

               Is Bin-Laden the Pawn of China?
On September 11, 2001, a Chinese Peoples Liberation Army transport aircraft from 
Beijing landed in Kabul with the most important delegation the ruling Taliban 
had ever received.  They had come to sign the contract with Afghanistan that 
Osama bin-Laden had asked for, that would provide the Taliban state of the art 
air defense systems in exchange for the Taliban's promise to end the attacks by 
Muslim extremists in China's north-western regions.  Hours later, CIA Director 
George Tenet received a coded ""red alert"" message from Mossad's Tel Aviv 
headquarters that presented what he called a ""worst case scenario"" -- that China 
would use a ruthless surrogate, bin-Laden, to attack the United States.  In 
SEEDS OF FIRE, Gordon Thomas asks the question: In the war on terror, is China 
with us or against us?  Click here:

I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I
tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my
corpora (the full test results with and without HTML tag stripping

comment block also says,
# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate
reductions.  I should test that again now.

so we've made tons of progress on the f-n rate since then.  But the mere
presence of HTML tags still remains a significant clue for c.l.py traffic,
so I'm left with the same comment:
# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.
If we want to take the focus of this away from c.l.py traffic, I can't say
what effect HTML stripping would have (I don't have suitable test data to
measure that on).",0,0

The Freedom Rides
By Denis Mueller
At the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.
By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  ""When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.""

On May 4th, 1961 they set out to New Orleans. In the upper 
south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. 
Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.

Meanwhile, their plight became international news and 
""Freedom Riders"" left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.
The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.

Teresa's written a wonderful blog post about the revelation that Tyco's crooked 
CEO spent ""6,000 on a shower curtain, $15,000 for an umbrella stand, $2,900 on 
coat hangers, $5,960 on bedsheets and $2,200 for a wastebasket."" 
    Naturally, they assured her that not only is it possible to pay $6,000 for 
    your shower curtains and $2,200 for a wastebasket, it's a Good Thing to do 
    so, practically essential. Then they explain how: 
    ""Sometimes the wastebasket is exposed,"" said Joel Joves, a designer with 
    offices in Rancho Santa Fe and Beverly Hills. ""If you have a fabulous study 
    or master bedroom, then maybe we need a pewter-finished basket with 
    decorative pearl beadings or semiprecious stones to complete the look of a 
    room."" 
    That's Fool Money at work. If you can't find a sufficiently fabulous 
    wastebasket for $200, $500 absolute tops, you're not half trying.

Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes
By Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01
If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.
But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.
Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
can't get the chicks with that anymore.""
The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.
The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.
The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.
""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""
At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.
Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.
The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.
But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.
""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job.""
Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""
Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.
""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""
Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.
""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation.""
Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.
""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along.""
Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.
""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""",0,0

STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX
by
John Sterne
The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.
ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.
The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.
Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.
The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.
David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.
-------------
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m.
The Wages of September 11
There is no going back.
September 11 changed our world. Those who deny such a watershed event take a
superficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply
because the sun still rises and sets.
This is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing
into the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans  all seen live in real
time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,
which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers
dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the
manifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and
centering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,
they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing
has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.
Islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally
repugnant  and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By
lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the
vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and
bombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only
ghoulish not fearsome.
The more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found
them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate
them and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite
another to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily
dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good
theater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British
commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and
an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of
the attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,
but also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,
the plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist
paradise on earth.
Foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with
Europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic
nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters 
a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold
War. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has
insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an
antidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power
is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often
dubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally
exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the
moment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed
the problems inherent in ""the European way"" became all too apparent:
pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract
moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and
constant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire
while we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with
only a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more
sobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European
hobbits after September 11.
America learned that ""moderate"" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile
Islamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti
means nothing special to an American  at least not proof of being any more
friendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.
Indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of
their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like NATO  belongs to a
pre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn
that broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is
just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come
from friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan
offer more long-term hope than ""stable regimes"" like the Saudis; governments
that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa; the Saudi royal
family, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which
has snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic
reformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic
governments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as
Arab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.
The post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the
military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq ""chicken
hawks"" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings
hollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan's shrillness
against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery
ended than resonant of Patton's audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.
More Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those
soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30
years ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of
Vietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no
generation of Americans in the present military  other than a few thousand
brave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama  who have been in
sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American
soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security
is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in
lower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the
Pentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.
Real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than
rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad
as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at
home. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into
harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect
thousands in high-rises.
Politics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical
conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes
repellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe
to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose
belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were
so often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.
No longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet
Communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions
of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise
open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,
even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in
the Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if
multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western
construct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim
nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the
Left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and
idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president
astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.
All this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the
subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we
will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.",0,0

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to

It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly

"DEAR SIR,
I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.
I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.
No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.
Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.
Best personal regards,

"Hi,
I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?
In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...
You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.
Well, grasshopper, think again ...
It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!
Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.
Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.
If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulk emailer who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...
If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!
Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!
Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  
It's that simple ...
All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.
The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All it takes 
is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, and some 
basic familiarity with the Internet.
I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  
You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  
If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!
I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.
Here goes ...
Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  
If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!
All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.
You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.
Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?
No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Spambook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...
I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Spambook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!
I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.
As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!
Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Spambook! 
Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.

Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely

Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 
 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head!

Rastafari.
That is, if you concede that of the two founding branches, only the

thinly-veneered anti-colonial hooligans.  
There is also Vietnamese Buddhism, unless you count setting fire to

You'd have to explain ""found in the wild"".  For example, I know of
no violence perpetrated by the South Pacific ""Cargo Cults"" outside
of a pretty darn /mean/ game of cricket.

When we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we
noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.
The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.
(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)
    S> .. most Protestants are unionists who want the
    S> province to remain part of Britain.
Mebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.
It's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their
sacriments.
    S> ... Police records and historians agree that the most lethal
    S> group by far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a
    S> goal of a united Ireland
And which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and
Historians sit?  If the Russians had invaded the USA as feared in
episodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized
to become a ""lethal force"", or would they have just said, ""Oh well,
there goes /that/ democracy!"" and settle in under communist rule?
Just wondering.
2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
It is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint
Chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was
a major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous
interview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his
point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states
so easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.
The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that
escalation of violence is not a solution.

"Hi All,
Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.
The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.
Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?
Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity
I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:
AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1
... which is most of the defaults.
USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)
But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.
btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.

Subject: [POLITICOS] Re: ""Bowling for Columbine,"" Opens This Friday
Michael,
Why is it that people who consider voting in an election an 
inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message? 
 Don't get me wrong -- I think this is the case.  People will go to 
see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to 
express their malice and discontent towards not only the present 
regime in America, but also the corrupt, empty, shallow pantomime 
which cast them into power.
In reality, today the voting that takes place via the act of 
consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth 
and dimpling the appropriate chad, or some other such convoluted act 
of free democratic expression.
Why?  Because in America, they believe in dollars.  Dollars don't lie. 
 In practise, they are the last frontier of truth in America, 
universally accepted as expressions of fear, desire, passion, and 
need.  Compared to the swing of the almighty buck, and Jeb Bush knows 
this, a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning.
Given that fact, I modestly propose an entirely new, though wholly 
logical, extension to the current democratic system in place in 
America:
I propose we augment, and effectively replace, the electoral system 
with a political stock market.  We should accept that Politicians are 
entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in America, and 
embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects 
their intent.  A politician should issue a constant number of shares 
dependent upon his tenure in government.  Those shares should be 
traded on an open exchange, say the G.R.E.E.D. (short, of course, for 
the ""Global Realists' Electoral Exchange -- Democratic"").  Politicians 
we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their 
ability to maintain office grows.  As the truth about their embezzling 
campaign funds for weekend trips to Maui with their interns is 
revealed, of course, their fortunes will fall.
This represents an opportunity for the market forces -- those same 
forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal 
protest -- to voice their opinion on the quality of America's 
governance during the intervening four years between elections.  
Elections themselves will in effect become meaningless, as they are 
now, since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each 
and every congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.
Just think of the coverage that could be given on MSNBC!  ""Strom 
Thurman (STROM: news - quotes) was down 15% today on fears that his 
latest heart operation will render him unable to attend Senate Armed 
Services committee meetings until November..""  This would provide 
rejuvenating content to the econo-political news sector, which has 
found post-economic-bubble coverage to be both tiresome and 
deoressing.  The establishment of this new stock exchange would of 
course create jobs for newly unemployed (and governmentally retrained) 
IT systems engineers who could, after passing the electoral securities 
exam, become floor traders.
This would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which 
candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their 
multi-billion-dollar campaigns.  The requirement for the support of 
legions of spin doctors, permanent campaign managers, and investor 
relations personnel would also create jobs -- perhaps even a new 
practice for Ernst & Young, Arthur Anderson, et al.  Insider trading 
scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch 
Martha Stewart as an unwitting beneficiary, thus spreading her 
influence to politics.
Dividends, if there are any on record, at the close of a politician's 
career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings.  
Pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support 
necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the Beltway set.  
Union funds, brokerages, and even pump-and-dump houses could benefit 
from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the 
Southeast, and the Bush Governmet would be allowed to place Social 
Security bets where they really mattered.   investors who lose their 
retirement, life savings, and support could rest assured that they 
were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors.
Although there's no way to protect any of these for Worldcom-like 
crashes, ambitious, inspired, District Attorneys could file criminal 
suits against Candidates and Campaign Managers who underperform 
expectations, thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty 
-- instead, they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves.
On the whole, I believe the system could work.  I could certainly work 
as well as our beloved securities trading industry and, given the 
American electoral system's success at effectively expressing the will 
of the people, it certainly couldn't do any worse...
In the meantime, Mike, I think I'll go see your movie and try to 
depose the President.
-Ian.

film, ""Bowling for Columbine,"" will open in New York and Los Angeles.
It is, I promise, the last thing the Bushies want projected on the 
movie
screens across America this week. The film is, first and foremost, a
devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for 
profit
and power -- and no one, in all the advance screenings I have 
attended, has
left the theatre with anything short of rage. I truly believe this 
film has
the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do 
something.
This is not good news for Junior and Company. Not when they are 
trying to
drag us into another war. Not when a crazed sniper is exercising his
constitutional right to own a high-powered rifle. Not when John 
Ashcroft is
still prohibiting the FBI from looking through the gun background 
check
files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased 
any
weapons prior to 9/11 -- because THAT, we are told, would ""violate"" 
these
terrorists' sacred Second Amendment rights!
Yes, I believe this movie can create a lot of havoc -- but I will 
need ALL
of you to help me do this. Are you game?
Last February 5th, I wrote to tell you about a book I had written and 
how
the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to 
publish
anything critical of Bush after 9/11. I appealed to you to save 
""Stupid
White Men"" from the shredder and to go out and buy it. I promised you 
would
not regret it, and that the book would not only be a great read but an
important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of George W. Bush.
Within 24 hours, the book went to #1 on the Amazon best seller list. 
By the
fifth day, the book was already into its 9th printing. The publisher 
was
torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money. 
Greed won
out, and this Sunday the book enters its 31st week on the New York 
Times
best seller list -- and its 32nd printing. This is all because of 
you, my
crazy and loyal friends. You made this happen, against all the odds.
Now I would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work, 
""Bowling
for Columbine."" It's a movie that many critics have already called my 
best
film to date. They may be right. It is certainly the most provocative 
thing
I have ever done. I have spent three years on it and, I have to say, 
it
cuts
deeper, harder and funnier that anything I have given you so far.
The movie opens this Friday in New York and Los Angeles, and then in 
8 more
cities next week. How it does in these first ten cities will determine
whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it. That is the 
nutty
way
our films are released. If it doesn't have a big opening weekend, you 
can
kiss the film good-bye. Therefore, this weekend, this film must be 
seen by
millions of Americans. Can you help me make that happen?
""Bowling for Columbine"" is not a film simply about guns or school
shootings.
That is only the starting point for my 2-hour journey into the dark 
soul of
a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of 
violence,
both at home and around the world. With this movie I have broadened my
canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st
century, a nation that seems hell-bent on killing first and asking
questions
later. It is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and
terrorism against our own poor, and how we have created a culture of 
fear
that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore. And it's a
devastating comedy.
This film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts. No film has 
EVER
said the things I am saying in ""Bowling for Columbine."" I expect to be
attacked. I expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of
retribution. I expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many 
to
swallow.
This is why I need your help. Movies live or die based on what 
happens at
the box office the first weekend of its release. I need you, if you 
live in
the New York or L.A. area, to go see ""Bowling for Columbine"" this 
Friday
and
Saturday -- and take as many family members and friends with you as
possible. I guarantee you will not be disappointed -- and you may 
just see
one of the best films of the year.
Monday night in Times Square, ""Bowling for Columbine"" had its 
premiere. The
crowd was amazing, as it was this past Saturday night at the Chicago 
Film
Festival. The audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud
throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line.
The hate mail, the threats, the promises of retribution have already
started
to roll in to the distributor of this movie, United Artists. They are 
not
backing down. But how long will this last? I need all of you in the 
New
York
tri-state and southern California areas to go see ""Bowling for 
Columbine""
THIS weekend -- the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when 
it
comes to your town. A strong opening not only means that the rest of
America
will see this film, it means that a good number of people who see it 
are
going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved. 
If it
does poorly, I will have a difficult time finding the funding for the 
movie
I want to make next -- a film about 9/11 and how Bush is using that 
tragic
day as a cover for his right-wing agenda.
Don't let that happen. Don't let the NRA have one more success by 
stopping
the wider distribution of this movie. And, together, let us not remain
silent in our opposition to Bush's phony war against Iraq.
If you live in New York, you can see it at the Lincoln Plaza, the 
Sunshine
and the Loews 19th St. In L.A., you can catch it at the Sunset 5, the
Westwood Regent, Laemmle Sunset, Laemmle Towncenter (Encino), Landmark
Rialto (Pasadena), and Regal University (Irvine). Also, please 
forward this
to your other friends and tell them to go see ""Bowling for Columbine"" 
this
weekend.
And finally, don't miss our new website www.bowlingforcolumbine.com
Thank you for your help with this. I feel so honored and privileged 
to have
so many people interested in my work. Last January I was getting 
70,000
hits
a month on my website. Last month, I got 17 million hits. This alone 
speaks
volumes about the vast majority all of us belong to who are sick and 
tired
of what is going on and are longing for an alternative source of
information.
I hope that you enjoy ""Bowling for Columbine.""
Thank you again...
Yours,
Michael Moore

And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually 
quite funny .. if DMA was enabled for the CD-ROM *and* you tried to access 
a CD with Joliet extensions. Otherwise it worked just fine with DMA

Odd. Did I certify that one? What's the 7-digit IBM model number, and

That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo
records with spamprob exactly equal to UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB.  Such records
aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.
That's pretty good.  I wonder how much better you could do by using some
custom pickler.  I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of
what I would call bloat:
import anydbm, hammie
d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes(""ham.db"")
db = anydbm.open(""ham.db"")
db[""neale""], len(db[""neale""])
  ('ccopy_reg\n_reconstructor\nq\x01(cclassifier\nWordInfo\nq\x02c__builtin__\nobject\nq\x03NtRq\x04(GA\xce\xbc{\xfd\x94\xbboK\x00K\x00K\x00G?\xe0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00tb.', 106)
d.wordinfo[""neale""], len(`d.wordinfo[""neale""]`)
  (WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)
Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled
version of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string
representation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using
the string representation instead of the pickle, right?
Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it
is.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every
value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a
ton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.

     New $199 PC Doesn't Do Windows
     - Oct 2, 2002 03:53 PM (AP Online)

AP Technology Writer
  
  It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts
have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.
  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.
  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,
runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has
been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away
from the Microsoft monopoly.

Thanks Tony, but I think doing it using component files will get a .signature 
by default, but I have many diferent signatures and I want to insert one of 
that signatures using a keyboard command. So for a message I will insert a 
signature, but for another message I will insert a different signature.
Is it possible? I am using sedit for my messages.
Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).
However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.
I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.
Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.
I hope this helps some.

  | Interesting...I don't think this was my bug.
  | It appears that Msg_Change was asked to change to message ""-"".

Something like that is quite possible, but perviously typing nonsense
in didn't cause tracebacks, and now it does, and the traceback came
from the sequence code...

Perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status
line complaining about my lousy typing.   That's probably what it
should keep on doing (the ""red"" part isn't important obviously..)
Tell me what keystroke made it happen so I can reproduce it and I'll see what 
I can do about it (or if I can't, I'll hand it off to Brent).

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).
However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:
http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html
whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
mount the fat32 partition.
Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run.

Server company releases new AMD model
Angstrom Microsystems, a small Boston company specializing in 
   thin servers, has released a new model that squeezes two servers, 
   each with two Advanced Micro Devices Athlon 2100+ processors, into

Greetings! 
You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 
If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 
MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 
The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 
HERE'S GOOD NEWS 
There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 
With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 
I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 
To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 
Cordially, 
Majee
P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!",1,1

The other thing on my todo list (probably tonight's tram ride home) is

Uh... the reason is simple. Habeas runs something called the

this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through.
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your

Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to
town on violators.
The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail

CHRIS TEACHES THE BASICS:
If you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their PC, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the VHS release of
Computer Basics
in the GnomeStore. Chris teams with TechTV cohort, Kate Botello, to lead novices on a journey through their computer. From basic interactions, to installing apps, to using the Internet and e-mail, Chris and Kate have all the basics covered. Help out a friend and
get them a copy
today.
Wednesday's trip went fairly smooth overall, and I actually 
enjoyed helping out my friend Larry with some server 
software installation and network configuration tasks. His 
kids seemed impressed with the new ability to copy files 
between the five different computers and have Internet 
access at any of them. Ahh, yes... geeks in the making.
After that project was finished, I met up with Jake at a 
nearby Starbucks to shoot the breeze and catch up on all 
things Lockergnome. We email all the time, but it's nice to 
have a face-to-face conversation for a change. He had just 
finished establishing new phone service with Verizon, so he 
has a fun new PalmOS-based phone to play with.
After the dose of caffeine, I headed up to Boone, Iowa to 
hook up with my cousin Casey and his wife of two months, 
Stephanie. Their new house is awesome, but disappointing, as 
there was no high-speed Internet connection or wireless 
networking. We'll have to fix that. For now, I'll remain 
impressed with the geothermal heating/cooling system and the 
vast potential of the unfinished basement that will someday 
make an incredible rec room [insert suitable Tim Allen grunt 
here].
Casey is ticked about all of the rain recently because it 
keeps eroding his dirt front yard into the drainage ditch. 
The back yard is in great shape, as there was sod laid after 
construction finished up, but he decided to save a few bucks 
and seed the front himself next spring. This now assumes 
that he'll have a front yard left by then.
The rain turned out to be the last event of the evening. 
I drove through the beginning of the storms on the way from 
Ankeny to Boone, and I just knew it was going to be a rough 
drive home later since they were only getting started at 
that time. I was correct. What would normally be an hour and 
45 minute drive turned into nearly two and a half hours and 
many, many animal sightings. As the night wore on, I was 
half expecting to see someone building an ark in a 
cornfield. Must have been where the animals were headed.
The rain guage at home showed 3.25"" this morning, adding 
to the 1.25"" and 2.5"" amounts dumped out of it within the 
last week. I considered setting the sprinkler up in the 
front yard today as an attempt at neighborly humor, but 
figured I'd just be labeled as a complete moron instead.
So, what did I forget to take with me, you ask? 
Directions to Larry's house. DOH! I had to dig out the 
notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly 
memorize the route. Instead, I decided to transcribe the 
list on my Jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to 
read as I navigated through the streets. There's still a use 
for printers in this world, without question. Reading text 
from the tiny screen bites. Larger print and bold text on a 
sheet of paper is the way to go. At least I didn't leave my 
PDA at home as well, which I actually considered doing.
See You in

provider at some point? While all of the marketing hype 
paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you 
really must consider before writing the check. The birds are 
some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there 
is a significant delay while the bits float up and back 
down. The absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one 
place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. Add in 
hops across the Internet and other hardware latency and it's 
common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 
milliseconds - an eternity when you're talking about TCP/IP 
connections. Now consider how VPN connections are affected, 
being that they are generally significantly slower on the 
ground without the extra 46,000 miles. Ouch! This white 
paper is a tad marketing driven, but I think their 
explanation of technology and how they are addressing VPN-
over-satellite connections is quite informative.

PGP Outlook Plug-in Vulnerability
http://www.nai.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/patches/patch-pgphotfix.asp
Even encryption software is potentially exposed to 
security problems. Network Associates' PGP software, which 
interfaces directly with Microsoft Outlook, has been found 
to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. Exposed 
systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's 
choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to 
anywhere. Tracking down the source could be rather 
difficult. Hotfixes for each of NAI's products are available 
on their website.

Intro to Relational Databases
http://www.15seconds.com/issue/020522.htm
You know what a database is, right? Sure you do. Can you 
explain what a relational database is all about? Correctly? 
There's a lot more to database management and development 
than dumping a bunch of records into tables and generating 
reports. Proper design is crucial. Trust me. I've been on 
the receiving end of some lazy programming efforts that 
ignore the foundation of relational databases, and it 
usually results in additional work later.
GnomeSTUFF
Smile While You Surf
I like creative use of 404 pages, so sue me. Some of you have complained about the one Chris created for display when you come across a bogus link on the Lockergnome web site, which I don't understand. Would you rather stare at that stupid-looking, uninformative and generally useless one that your browser provides by default?
Cramsession.com posted some unique ""excuses"" for their site being down for maintenance, and I thought I'd share a few:
Roses are red
Our web site is resting
We're fixing the server
While Everquesting
In the interest of research, we're testing to see how long it takes a Network Administrator to get through a people-size maze to the web servers. As soon as he finds them, we'll be back online... Unless the Marketing Minotaur gets him first.
Suicide note found on the web server: ""I've had it. I can't take the heat anymore. You ran me ragged, and what thanks did I get? None. Null. Nothing. I gave and I gave, and you still wanted more I spent every second of my day trying to make you happy, but it was never enough. Always work faster, do more, stay late, work overtime, be more efficient. I was never good enough for you anyway. You deserve better. Signed CPU.""
You have reached the Cramsession Maintenance Page.
While you are staring at this page, waiting for the website to come back up, (should take about an hour or two) We'd like to offer the following fun activities:
Hold your breath until you see black spots dancing in front of your eyes.
Spin around in your chair until you get nauseous. Wheee!
Pretend your mouse is a microphone. Dictate a memo into it where you outline your plans for global domination.
Connect the dots!
.   .   .   .   .   .   .
Get monitor cleaner so you can wipe ink off of screen from connecting the dots.
We apologise for the inconvenience of our missing web site. We're doing something really ""high tech"" and ""important"" behind this ""maintenance"" curtain. We'll be back just as soon as we catch all the gophers.....Again.
HELP! I'm locked in the Server Room. Please send Help! And I'm running out of potato chips, too!
Recommend It!

Hijacker High (8/30)
Dalal Mughrabi was a Palestinian woman who participated in a 1978 bus
hijacking in which 36 Israelis and an American nature photographer,
Gail
Ruban, were killed. Mughrabi has a Palestinian high school named after
her, and it's apparently starting to show signs of wear. Fortunately,
the United States Agency for International Development has stepped in
with money to help renovate it.

Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,
As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.
Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.
I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on
CNET Radio
every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
Sincerely,
David Coursey

"Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

    :0fw
    | spamassassin -P

    :0
    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
    $SPAM

Which just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins
""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.

SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.
Do you feel capable of writing such a tool?  It doesn't look too hard.

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.
Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.
D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""
Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.
The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.
Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.
""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""",0,0

I'm using SA via spamc/spamd, and a global /etc/procmail file.  I'm
wondering if this would also work in that fashion.
spamc will skip every file bigger than 250k on it's own. It's got the 
command line switch -s to change this value. But it doesn't hurt of course 
to use the procmail limit.

Thank

Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in
""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""
If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and
why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income
.
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between
200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt
. For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.
With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.
The income potential is substantial in this profession.
We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year
.
Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.
Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
Quote's from several of our students:
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.
My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
.Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.
You have the video opened doors for me in the future.
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us:
""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week
and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months""
From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:
With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
Please call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8
.
We have Service Support
staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week
. If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.

you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We

"Dear fellow eBay user,
I listed this CD on eBay a few months ago and here's 
what happened.  I got an email from Safeharbor saying 
that all my auctions had been cancelled and that the CD 
was permanently ""banned"" from being sold on eBay.  From 
then on, I called it the ""Banned CD""!
So why did eBay ban it?  Maybe they figured you shouldn't 
have access to this type of information, or maybe they 
didn't think we could cram all of these programs onto 
one CD Rom.  I'll let you decide.
This CD will teach you things that eBay, Uncle Sam, and 
others just don't want you to know.  I am not responsible 
for how you use some of this information and it is 
provided for educational purposes only.  Here are just a 
few of the things you will learn ...
*** Find confidential info on anyone in 30 minutes or 
less on the Internet.  
    You'll be able to track down your old flame, find 
    out how much money your ex is hiding in their bank 
    account, or run a background check on proespective 
    client or employee.  Even government agencies have 
    trouble obtaining much of this information.  You 
    will have all the resources of any professional 
    investigator right at your fingertips - on your 
    home computer!
*** List of companies who will issue you a college 
    degree (including a Phd.) for a fee.  No study 
    required!
*** Learn how to get FREE cable and DSS channels, 
    including the adult stations and Pay-Per-View!
 
*** List of suppliers of ""questionable"" items, such as 
    fcc banned communications devices, scanners, night 
    vision goggles, passports, fake identification, and 
    everything else that you won't find in the back of 
    Soldier of Fortune magazine!
*** Find products to resell on the Internet with our 
    Wholesale Directory containing over 1 million 
    (that's right, one million!) wholesale sources for 
    computers, electronics, beanies, trend items, 
    jewelry, cars, collectibles, and everything else!  
*** Over 25 million email addresses, fresh and targeted!
    You can use these to contact the people and send 
    them your advertisements.

    whole new file in the credit bureau computers.

""contraband"" info?  It was banned on eBay, has been

I thought about that.  The first order approximation would be to just add 
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their 
each a different width, it would look funny.
I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.
I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

"Hi There,
I wanted to spread this good karma to you.
This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.
I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.
I am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.
Please help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!

Hmmm, just as I thought.  In other words, it has no practical uses
whatsoever ;) ... do the biz guys in your office /really/ think WISPs
are really going to shell out /their/ money to find a house or two
they can't reach?  Experience suggests (a) they won't care and (b)
they will even sign up that errant house and then give them a
run-around blaming the dead-spot on ""unsupported vendor equipment"".
Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the ""WISPs"" want to do
with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities
are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which
is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next
generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large
scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless
configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and
others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit
considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize
the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless
is tied into fiber at multiple points.
The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but
a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth
measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to
well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and
bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an
order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and
proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the
cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers
can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low
bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of
large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective
bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's
long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to
keep things sane.
Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,
especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the
system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more
efficient).

Yesterday Viridiana came to my place and dragged me out to look at the sky. It 
was beautiful. Odd colors and light. Obviously we wondered what it was. Today 
Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much 
street light to make a good photo, so I am happy to have found the photo from

Also this week, we've got some very handy utilities. First,
there's Chilkat, a cool zip/unzip ActiveX control that you can
add to any language with ActiveX support (which is most major
ones). But my personal favorite is VB-PowerWrap, a simple tool
that takes all the far-flung bits and pieces of your Visual Basic
masterpiece and socks them all away into one executable file
for ease of distribution.

Chilkat Zip 6.0.2
Need to add zip capability to your apps? Create and
   decompress zip archives with the Chilkat Zip ActiveX
   control. The control provides easy access to individual files
   stored within a zip archive. You can search for a file within
   the zip using a wildcard string and then extract individual
   files or files matching a pattern. Files can be unzipped to
   any directory, and the control's memory management allows any
   size file to be compressed or decompressed in a constant
   memory footprint. The control allows you to compress directly
   from memory buffers or strings, as well as add multiple files
   with wildcarding. There's even a real-time progress monitor
   for zip and unzip operations. Chilkat supports Active Server
   Pages, Visual Basic, Visual C++, Delphi, C++ Builder, and all
   languages that use ActiveX controls.

VB-PowerWrap 3.1
Distribute Visual Basic applications the easy way with
   VB-PowerWrap. VB-PowerWrap embeds all dependent and
   non-dependent files into the executable of your VB program,
   including DLLs and OCXs, graphics, databases, and text files,
   to create a single clickable application. VB-PowerWrap scans
   a VB project, wraps the appropriate files, and creates a
   self-contained file for distribution. In addition,
   VB-PowerWrap compresses all DLLs and OCXs and registers
   appropriate controls on the user's machine if needed. It
   works with Visual Basic 4, 5, and 6.

"I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.
I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).
Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

Can you give us an example of an application where 1-m resolution
would be worth the considerable expense?
An example:  Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a
metro area when deploying wireless networks.  By having every single tree
and building detail and similar, you can ""see"" even tiny dead spots due to
physical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map data
for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is
also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling
existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further
deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into a
slick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and management
system and you've really got something...
For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate.

Date:  Mon, 23 Sep 2002 17:49:47 -0400
Chris, 

I'm home now, and this copy of exmh is pretty bad -  I'm running from
CVS on Sunday night - the only change since then was the one you made
this morning for ""bulletproofing in MhReadSeqs"".

I run exmh, and I can visably see it count up the number of unseen
messages as it looks through the folders - I have about 3000 unseen
messages in maybe 10 or 12 folders.    It takes a few seconds for all
of the folders in the fcache to turn blue.  
This is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little 
while (in the background) to build the sequences window.  There is probably 
some tuning possible in this area.
In +inbox, I have 4 unread messages.  They aren't blue, they are
white background with a normal colored font.
I changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to 
a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen 
messages may be in.  I *did* ask Brent before I did it.  If you like the old 
behavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.
If I click on a message, I get the following traceback:

invalid command name ""Mh_MarkSeen""
    while executing
""Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid""
    (procedure ""Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen"" line 5)
    invoked from within
""$cmd $mhProfile(path)/$exmh(folder)/$msgid mimeHdr""
    (procedure ""MsgShow"" line 23)
    invoked from within
""MsgShow $msgid""
    (procedure ""MsgChange"" line 18)
    invoked from within
""MsgChange 66 show""
    invoked from within
""time [list MsgChange $msgid $show""
    (procedure ""Msg_Change"" line 3)
    invoked from within
""Msg_Change $msgNum $show""
    (procedure ""Msg_Pick"" line 8)
    invoked from within
""Msg_Pick $lineno show""
    (procedure ""FtocRangeEnd"" line 12)
    invoked from within
""FtocRangeEnd [lindex [split [.ftoc.t index current] .] 0] 0""
    (command bound to event)
This is because of your Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen which is calling a function 
which no longer exists.
I suspect you need
	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid
now instead of 
	Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid
It appears that the message does get marked as seen though, as it
loses the white background, and nmh reports the same.  

If I click the flist button, it zero's the unseen count, and then
there is again a visible delay as it counts up all the unseen 
messages - maybe 3-4 seconds.

I really think my installation is OK now, but if this behavior is just
really strange I'll blow everything away and reinstall.  I'm happy to
spend some time helping to track this down, I don't really need exmh.

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to

""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job
of the FTC/SEC/IRS/etc to make sure you invest your money wisely (and I
have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job). 
They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.
So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.
So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?
Perhaps it is just a matter of personal preference, but I'd rather not

In article <E17v8Mw-0004eS-00@pmenage-dt.ensim.com> you write:
I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this
problem with any other windows, though. Just the exmhunseen window.
How about enabling the ""Show unseen message count in folder cache""
option? It displays the number of unseen messages next to each folder name
(if greater than 0), so you don't really need the unseen window unless
you're using more sequences than just ""unseen"".
Paul
	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show
unseen message count in folder cache"". Where is that? And in what version?
(I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)
	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
state, etc. 
	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:
NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
DESKTOP: 0
RES: 1600 1200
WH: 114 173
XY: 1655 150 0 0
LAYER: 4
STICKY: 1
SKIPTASK: 0
SKIPWINLIST: 0
SKIPFOCUS: 0
SHADE: 2
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
	I changed:
XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
There was my window! 
	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:
NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE
	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
shading.)
	Hmm. Weird. 
	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)

When I worked as a PC repair tech for a Computer store chain, I did
run across quite a few DVD drives that would lock up if DMA was
enabled.  It's more of a chipset/drive problem than a Drive by itself.
And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually 
quite funny .. if DMA was enabled for the CD-ROM *and* you tried to access 
a CD with Joliet extensions. Otherwise it worked just fine with DMA

""I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. <BR>
I have been under great stress in my business. <BR>
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping <BR>
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst <BR>
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. <BR>
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. <BR>
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy <BR>
when I go out walking."" <BR>
- Carolyn Munn <BR>
<BR>
""I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that <BR>
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed <BR>
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging <BR>
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. <BR>
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"" <BR>
-Rita Mills McCoy <BR>
<BR>
""I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, <BR>
in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels <BR>
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging <BR>
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal <BR>
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this <BR>
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking <BR>
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! <BR>
-Alan Ross, 43 years old <BR>
<BR>
GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 <BR>
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH. <BR>

<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B> WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)?</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B>  <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which <BR>
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the <BR>
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically <BR>
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few <BR>
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones <BR>
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout <BR>
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. <BR>
<BR>
Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. <BR>
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously <BR>
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original <BR>
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to <BR>
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability <BR>
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. <BR>
<BR>
Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. <BR>
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the <BR>
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance <BR>
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the <BR>
proper dosage amounts. <BR>
<BR>
GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, <BR>
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny <BR>
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate <BR>
the activities of the vital organs. The word ""hormone"" is derived from a Greek word <BR>
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the <BR>
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other <BR>
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly <BR>
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including <BR>
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also <BR>
helps restore hair color and hair loss. <BR>

THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH?</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B>  <BR>
<BR>
Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production <BR>
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per <BR>
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, <BR>
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians <BR>
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. <BR>
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical <BR>
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been <BR>
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only <BR>
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by <BR>
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. <BR>
</B></FONT>
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B> <BR>
GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61</B></FONT>

</B></FONT>
<FONT face=""MS Sans Serif"">
<FONT size=3>
<FONT color=""#FF0000""><B> <BR>
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. <BR>
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. <BR>
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age <BR>
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, <BR>
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages <BR>
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, <BR>
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called <BR>
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. <BR>
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. <BR>
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include <BR>
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.</B></FONT>

VIRGIN'S latest airliner is being revamped after randy passengers
discovered a tiny cabin was just the place to join the Mile High Club.
The 130million Airbus 340-600 is fitted with a 5ft x 4ft mother and
baby room with a plastic table meant for changing nappies.
But couples keep wrecking it by sneaking in for a quick bonk.
Virgin has replaced the table several times even though the plane only
came into service a few weeks ago.
It is named Claudia Nine after sexy model Claudia Schiffer, 32, who
launched it in July.
Now Virgin bosses have asked Airbus to build a stronger table.
At first, German engineers responsible for the jet's interior were
baffled by the problem.
The table is designed to take the weight of a mum and baby.
One Airbus worker said: ""We couldn't work it out. Then the penny
dropped. It didn't occur to the Germans that this might happen. It
caused great amusement.""
The firm say the cost of strengthening the tables will be about 200.
A Virgin spokeswoman said: ""Those determined to join the Mile High
Club will do so despite the lack of comforts.
""We don't mind couples having a good time but this is not something
that we would encourage because of air regulations.""
The new Airbus is the world's longest airliner, with teasing slogan
""Mine is bigger than yours"". Virgin is using it on flights to the Far
East and the US.",0,0

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with

tells it the user name is.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's true.
<p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
<br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
<br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
<br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
<p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
<br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
<br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
<br>it is absolutely true.
<p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
<br>not produce results.
<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
<br>Poor sales letters.
<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
<br>your sales letter...
<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
<br>going to read them.
<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
<br>account from the ""real world.""&nbsp; It effectively creates
<br>interest and further establishes the point.
<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
<br>words were, ""It's true.""&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
<br>you've got a winner.
<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
<br>Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
<br>will aid them.
<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
<br>of your ideas.
<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
<br>words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
<br>but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""&nbsp; Leads aren't
<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
<br>what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
<br>""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
<br>Hemingway.
<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
<p>Or this.
<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
<br>force the reader to get distracted.
<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
<br>readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
<br>for&nbsp; me?""&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
<br>reader.
<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
<br>the benefits, not the features.
<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a ""work
<br>at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
<br>5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
<br>5 hours a week.""&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
<br>match made for them.
<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
<br>letters...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
<br>HERE to continue.""
<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
<br>If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
<br>that let the mouse get away.""&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
<br>than a speeding bullet.""&nbsp; ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
<br>""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
<br>word pictures stick in our minds?
<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
<br>services as back-end products.
<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
<br>this anywhere else.""
<p>17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
<br>weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
<br>mind.&nbsp; ""What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?""
<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
<br>think, ""This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
<br>I can expect.""&nbsp; ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
<br>human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
<br>Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
<br>leave no impression whatsoever.""
<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
<br>Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""&nbsp; Then, address that
<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
<br>reader from making the purchase.
<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; ""If these people have
<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
<br>probably will too.""&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
<br>from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
<br>field.
<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
<br>that important.
<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; ""Wouldn't you like to
<br>make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
<br>you like to be as successful as I am?""&nbsp; Avoid any question
<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
<br>feel like they are inferior.
<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
<br>the credibility of your main offer.
<p>25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
<br>and ""But that's not all.""&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
<br>value and benefits to the reader.
<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
<br>""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
<br>bonuses.""&nbsp; ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
<br>I've got to hurry.""&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
<br>system in place.&nbsp; ""Operators are standing by.""&nbsp; Their order
<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
<br>product or service RISK-FREE.
<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
<br>just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""&nbsp; ""Order today!""
<br>""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""&nbsp; You've got them
<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
<br>to ""Act Fast!""&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
<br>way?
<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

<p>Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.&nbsp; They'll
<br>tell you it's true.&nbsp; Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
<br>Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.&nbsp; They'll agree
<br>100% that it's true.&nbsp; Don't just take my word for it.
<p>In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
<br>selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
<br>emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
<br>it is absolutely true.
<p>It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.&nbsp; Really, they
<br>can.&nbsp; But, it takes several very important components to
<br>join the 5% who are successful on the web.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of those necessities is a website.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, your website does one of two things...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
<p>For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
<br>not produce results.
<p>And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
<br>Poor sales letters.
<p>Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
<br>If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
<br>your sales letter...
<p>1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
<br>Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
<br>sales letter to.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
<br>next door neighbor or your cat.&nbsp; Write your sales letter
<br>just like you are writing it to them personally.&nbsp; Why?
<br>Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
<br>seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
<br>Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
<br>to be read to an audience rather than one person.&nbsp; Keep your
<br>sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
<br>going to read them.
<p>2) Use an illustration to get your point across.&nbsp; In my
<br>sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
<br>the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
<br>constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
<br>businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
<br>making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
<br>across Montana on a grizzly bear.&nbsp; Leads have read of how
<br>getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
<br>marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
<br>a solid message.&nbsp; Tell stories that illustrate a point you
<br>are trying to make.&nbsp; Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
<br>account from the ""real world.""&nbsp; It effectively creates
<br>interest and further establishes the point.
<p>3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
<br>line.&nbsp; Your first line of the sales letter should
<br>immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
<br>more.&nbsp; Go back to the beginning of this article.&nbsp; The first
<br>words were, ""It's true.""&nbsp; I can guarantee you that either
<br>consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
<br>Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
<br>about.&nbsp; Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
<br>paragraphs into this article.&nbsp; Carefully craft your first
<br>line.&nbsp; If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
<br>you've got a winner.
<p>4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
<br>lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
<br>bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
<br>service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
<br>Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
<br>each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
<p>5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.&nbsp; Shortly after
<br>your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
<br>list of benefits to absorb.&nbsp; Hit them with your best shot.
<br>Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
<br>important things the reader will discover.&nbsp; By offering a
<br>killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
<br>create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
<br>copy.&nbsp; After all, if they are already interested after the
<br>first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
<br>finding out even more reasons why your product or service
<br>will aid them.
<p>6) Just let it all flow out.&nbsp; Write down everything that
<br>enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
<br>can edit it later.&nbsp; If you just sit and start writing
<br>everything you know about your product or service and how it
<br>will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
<br>information floods your mind.&nbsp; Write it ALL down.&nbsp; Then read
<br>through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
<br>many of the points.&nbsp; Edit it after you have exhausted all
<br>of your ideas.
<p>7) Make your sales letter personal.&nbsp; Make sure that the
<br>words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
<br>Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
<br>yourself.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
<br>but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
<br>your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""&nbsp; Leads aren't
<br>interested in you or your products, they are interested in
<br>themselves and their wants and needs.&nbsp; When you are finished
<br>with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
<br>webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
<br>what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
<br>""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.&nbsp; It's a free service.&nbsp; Make sure it's
<br>at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
<p>8) Write like you speak.&nbsp; Forget all of those rules that
<br>your grammar teacher taught you.&nbsp; Write your sales letters
<br>in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
<br>Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
<br>Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
<br>Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
<br>American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
<br>Hemingway.
<p>9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
<br>Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.&nbsp; Use short
<br>paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
<br>afraid to use short sentences.&nbsp; Like this one.
<p>Or this.
<p>See what I mean?&nbsp; Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
<br>the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
<br>force the reader to get distracted.
<p>10)&nbsp; Stress the benefits, not the features.&nbsp; Again,
<br>readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
<br>for&nbsp; me?""&nbsp; What need is it going to meet? What want is it
<br>going to fill?&nbsp; How is your product or service going to be
<br>of value or benefit to the reader?&nbsp; Spell it out.&nbsp; Don't
<br>focus on the features of your product or service , but
<br>rather how those features will add value to the life of your
<br>reader.
<p>For example:&nbsp; If you are selling automobile tires, you may
<br>very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
<br>but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
<br>do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
<br>we are traveling.&nbsp; So, instead of focusing on your selection,
<br>you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
<br>because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
<br>selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
<br>the benefits, not the features.
<p>11) Keep the reader interested.&nbsp; Some sales letters read
<br>like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
<br>perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
<br>filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
<br>understand.&nbsp; Unless you are writing to a very targeted
<br>audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
<br>might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
<br>and information that are easy to understand and follow.
<p>12) Target your sales letter.&nbsp; When you are finished with
<br>your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
<br>specific audience.&nbsp; For example: If you are selling a ""work
<br>at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
<br>words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
<br>women who are homemakers.&nbsp; Then, rewrite the same sales
<br>letter and target it to college students.&nbsp; Write another
<br>letter targeting senior citizens.&nbsp; Still another could be
<br>written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
<br>during summer vacation.&nbsp; The possibilities are endless.
<p>All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
<br>your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
<br>is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
<br>5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
<br>5 hours a week.""&nbsp; Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
<br>all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
<br>(you could easily target 100's of groups).
<p>Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
<br>mediums.&nbsp; You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
<br>in a campus ezine.&nbsp; The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
<br>advertised at a retirement community message board.
<p>By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
<br>open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
<br>to.&nbsp; And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
<br>match made for them.
<p>13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.&nbsp; Use short sentences
<br>and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
<br>grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
<br>thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
<br>letters...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...is to use a pause like this.
<p>Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
<br>to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
<br>if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
<br>several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
<br>line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
<br>get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
<br>HERE to continue.""
<p>14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.&nbsp; When the
<br>customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
<br>of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
<br>If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
<br>that let the mouse get away.""&nbsp; Use words to create a picture
<br>in the readers' mind.&nbsp; When you think of Superman, what
<br>comes to mind?&nbsp; Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
<br>than a speeding bullet.""&nbsp; ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
<br>""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
<br>word pictures stick in our minds?
<p>15) Focus on one product or service.&nbsp; Don't try to sell
<br>your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
<br>confuses the reader.&nbsp; Keep your ad copy directed at one
<br>specific product or service.&nbsp; Then, use other products and
<br>services as back-end products.
<p>16) Make it stand out.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself.&nbsp; There are
<br>hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
<br>same thing you are doing.&nbsp; How will you stand out among the
<br>crowd?&nbsp; Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
<br>breathe of originality.&nbsp; Your product or service is
<br>different. It's not like all of the rest.&nbsp; It is unique.
<br>Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
<br>competition.&nbsp; It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
<br>this anywhere else.""
<p>17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
<br>Delete.&nbsp; Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
<br>something?&nbsp; Get real.&nbsp; Don't make outrageous claims that
<br>are obviously not the truth.&nbsp; You'll ruin your reputation.
<br>Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
<br>reversed.&nbsp; Once you have been branded a liar, you will
<br>NEVER be anything but a liar.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you
<br>launch the most respectable, honest business available
<br>anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
<br>remember the crazy stuff you've said before.&nbsp; Be believable.
<br>Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
<p>18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
<br>rather be EXACT.&nbsp; Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
<br>weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
<br>information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
<br>mind.&nbsp; ""What am I really getting here?&nbsp; Does he even know?""
<br>When you use specific information, the reader begins to
<br>think, ""This person must have counted.&nbsp; I know exactly what
<br>I can expect.""&nbsp; ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
<br>human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
<br>Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
<br>leave no impression whatsoever.""
<p>19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
<br>want to know about your product or service.&nbsp; Answer all of
<br>their questions, anything they would want to consider before
<br>making a purchase.&nbsp; Think about it from their point of view.
<br>Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""&nbsp; Then, address that
<br>in your sales letter.&nbsp; Remove anything that would keep the
<br>reader from making the purchase.
<p>20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.&nbsp; Share actual
<br>excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
<br>your product or service. Many websites have an entire
<br>section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
<br>compliments listed.&nbsp; Satisfied customers remove some of the
<br>doubt in the mind of the reader.&nbsp; ""If these people have
<br>found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
<br>probably will too.""&nbsp; Especially effective are testimonials
<br>from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
<br>field.
<p>21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
<br>A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
<br>ad copy.&nbsp; Use them frequently -but don't overuse.&nbsp; A well-
<br>placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
<br>them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
<br>paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
<br>your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.&nbsp; They are
<br>that important.
<p>22) Avoid asking stupid questions.&nbsp; ""Wouldn't you like to
<br>make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
<br>you like to be as successful as I am?""&nbsp; Avoid any question
<br>that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
<br>feel like they are inferior.
<p>23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
<br>If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
<br>purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
<br>to influence them to buy in the future.&nbsp; By offering a free
<br>item, you can&nbsp; request their email address in order to
<br>obtain the freebie.&nbsp; By doing this, you can now follow-up
<br>with the customer for a potential future sale.
<br>Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
<br>your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
<br>And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
<br>product or service which impresses the customer, they
<br>probably will be back as a customer soon.
<p>24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.&nbsp; One of the things
<br>that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
<br>is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
<br>I am offering.&nbsp; Ginsu made this one famous. They were
<br>selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
<br>was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
<br>it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
<br>bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
<br>the credibility of your main offer.
<p>25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
<br>and ""But that's not all.""&nbsp; These phrases effectively lead
<br>the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
<br>when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
<br>leads into bonus items.&nbsp; Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
<br>value and benefits to the reader.
<p>26) Always include a deadline.&nbsp; By including a deadline,
<br>you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
<br>""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
<br>bonuses.""&nbsp; ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
<br>I've got to hurry.""&nbsp; Let the customer know what they will
<br>be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
<br>they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
<br>miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
<br>are very effective.&nbsp; Every sales letter should have one.
<p>27) Tell them exactly how to order.&nbsp; Be clear as to the
<br>order process. Point them towards the order link.&nbsp; Tell
<br>them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
<br>etc.)&nbsp; Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
<br>If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
<p>28)&nbsp; Explain when the product will be delivered.&nbsp; How
<br>quickly will the order be processed?&nbsp; When will the order be
<br>available?&nbsp; Let the customer know exactly what they can
<br>expect when they place their order.&nbsp; The more specific you
<br>can be here, the better.&nbsp; Let them know that you have a
<br>system in place.&nbsp; ""Operators are standing by.""&nbsp; Their order
<br>will be handled properly.&nbsp; Tell them.
<p>29) Offer a money back guarantee.&nbsp; Take away their last
<br>reason to hold back.&nbsp; Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
<br>guarantee.&nbsp; Most people may not realize this, but in most
<br>cases, it's the law of the land.&nbsp; You are REQUIRED to give
<br>them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
<br>product or service.&nbsp; Since it's the law anyway, why not make
<br>it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
<br>product or service RISK-FREE.
<p>30) Instruct them to respond immediately.&nbsp; Many people
<br>just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""&nbsp; ""Order today!""
<br>""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""&nbsp; You've got them
<br>this far, now tell them what you want them to do.&nbsp; Get them
<br>to ""Act Fast!""&nbsp; Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
<br>on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
<br>way?
<p>31) Include a post script.&nbsp; People will always read the
<br>P.S.&nbsp; Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
<br>parts of your sales letter. Why?&nbsp; Because in many cases the
<br>visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
<br>end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.&nbsp; A
<br>P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
<br>see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
<br>description of what they will receive for their money. Use
<br>your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
<p>32) Include a second post script.&nbsp; You better believe
<br>if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.&nbsp; Use
<br>this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
<br>another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
<br>make them want to order.&nbsp; I guarantee you they will read it.
<p>Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
<br>a significant increase in the amount of responses you
<br>receive from your sales letters.&nbsp; In fact, it would be
<br>impossible for your responses to not improve.

Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the
Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,
too.
By ""meanings have evolved"" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words
have changed meaning or that our understanding of the Hebrew words have
changed? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had
evolved by time of the Pentateuch?
In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was
actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into
slavery.
This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the
Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg
Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.
In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar
claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments:
""""""
The translations since cause problems at each successive remove
We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an
issue.
I'm sure most everyone is familiar with the argument that the meaning of the commandment
is 'thou shalt not murder' rather than 'kill,'
This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our
knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word ""ratsach"". Most modern
translations I've seen translate it ""murder"" but elsewhere the word is
used
of an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers
wouldn't use the word ""murder"").

Well, I've made an updated libsigc++ 1.0.4 package. It rebuilds cleanly on

"ZDNet AnchorDesk Newsletter
THURSDAY, JULY 18, 2002
Why we're changing our publishing schedule
Dear Reader,
As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday
Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.
Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.
Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.
For now, the new schedule is being called a ""test,"" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.
I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on
CNET Radio
every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.
Sincerely,
David Coursey
Executive Editor

Folks who've been hacking on the DNSBLs: would it be worthwhile commenting
this in HEAD, seeing as it only gets .77 anyway?

Sounds like the (a) broken server and (b) low hitrate combine to make it
not-so-useful IMO.
No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use,
which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
services better.
The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.
Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

* There is no documentation on their website about how I can complain about
  this and have their customers financially penalized for sending me unsolicited

  Their contract is with their customers, not with us.

I'm not a banker, and I'm not a credit expert - but these people
speak from personal and professional experience. Draw your own
conclusions. Lockergnomie Sang Vo writes: ""Though you may have
zero liability for a fraudulent transaction, the paperwork and red
tape to work through if someone empties out all your funds can
leave you hurting for a while. There are many credit cards that
now offer zero liability for fraudulent transactions. So, contact
your credit card provider / bank to see if you can have such a
plan added to your card or if you can apply for one that does.""
And Russ Coover continues: ""If you purchase something with a
credit card, and you later decide to dispute the purchase (for a
reason such as the product was faulty and the merchant refuses to
replace it or, perhaps the product was never delivered), you can
legally dispute the charge with your credit card company. However,
if you use a debit card to make that purchase, you have no right
to dispute the charge.""
Jeff Morgan has a different interpretation of the regulation in
question (E): ""In 12 CFR II, Section 205.6, it's saying that if
you give your financial institution timely notice of the theft of
your card or PIN code (two business days), you are liable for no
more than $50, otherwise you may be liable for up to $500."" And
Tim Miller extends the translation: ""If someone puts a false
charge on a credit card, the worse that will happen is your
liability for $50, with the possibility that your next charge
might not go through because the thief used all of your available
balance.  If a false charge goes against your debit card and wipes
out your bank balance, however, outstanding checks can bounce.
 Your bank may be able to get you all of your money back, but the
payees of those bounced checks might sock you with $20-25
insufficient fund fees - and they are under no obligation to waive
those fees.  If you have  5 checks outstanding, you could be out
over $100.""
Frank Reyes was apparently lucky: ""Someone recently obtained my
debit card number through a local grocery store. I was told by the
checker at the grocery store that the card readers would only
accept Visa cards not ATM cards. I was very suspicious, and used
my debit card instead. Apparently, the store's computer had been
hacked, and my debit card number and name (among several
others)were forwarded to an unscrupulous individual. I was
reviewing my checking account online two days later, and noticed
an unauthorized charge against my account ($60.00). I contacted
the vendor that had charged my account and informed them of the
fraudulent charge. The vendor stopped the shipment, provided the
shipping address to my bank, and credited my account within 5 days
after I informed them (The delay in the fund reversal was due to
the 4th of July weekend). The only negative aspect is the fact
that I had to request a new debit card, which has yet to arrive.""
Further thoughts from Lockergnomie James Simbro: ""I'm not totally
sure on this, but I've been warned against using a debit card for
online purchases.  Yes, you may not be liable for any of the
false charges on a debit card (in the end), but in the meantime
(during your dispute) the money will be withheld from your account
and you will not have access to it. However with a credit card,
you are not responsible for funds that are in dispute. The
scenario I was given, was imagine if somebody falsely used your
debit card and cleaned out your checking account?  The money is
gone! False charges on a credit card are not ""real money"" until
somebody has to pay them.  I would guess that each bank has
different policies for debit card fraud. I might just have to call
mine and see what I'd face."" In short, be careful - no matter what
you use or where you choose to use your plastic.
See You in
August

{Manage your collections} It seems like everyone collects
something. In fact, just the other day I decided to start
collecting dust. It's much easier than collecting stamps. If you
do collect stamps, though, this organizer will help you keep track
of them all. Or you can use it to keep track of your Star Wars
trading card collection, or your coin collection, or your [insert
collection here] collection. It works for everything, get it? It's
also great for managing your MP3 lists, including ID3 tag editing.
""CYG is founded on an object-oriented database approach, and
carefully programmed with one goal in mind: universal usage.""

{Drive your drivers} Everyone else step outside while I have a
talk with the power geeks. If you're running on NT, 2000, or XP
and need to know what drivers you have running on your system,
this program can show you. That's not too shabby, but of course,
you can also change or even get rid of certain drivers if you
desire. And that's, um, even more not too shabby. And that Refresh
button is there to make sure you're seeing everything exactly how
you want it. ""DriverManager is a tool designed to allow System

Transloader
http://www.transloader.com/
""This site makes it easy to transfer files to your Web server.
Mostly it is useful for sites like FlamingText.com and
ImageBot.com to send generated images to another server (such as
your Web or FTP server). This is particularly useful for WebTV
users who can't save images on their own machine. Although we have
no pre-set limits (okay, it's 2.4 GB), the transfers that you do
through Transloader.com must be completed in five minutes. This
server is capable of transferring over 1 Gig per minute; if you
are talking to a slow server, your job may not complete in time.
Other transloaders sometimes suffer from overloading (too many
people using them), which is why I wrote this one. Hopefully, this
will never happen to us, but in any case, check these others out,
they have some nice services...""

To Share or Not to Share
Scribbled by Lee Smith
I think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is
being shared. If the song is a current release or recent, then I
do not believe in it. I can't consider it stealing because you
can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for
downloading. Those who did put the file online most likely feel
that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the CD.
However, I do not agree with RIAA or recording companies who are
attempting to make their CDs ""rip proof"" either. I do not feel
they have the right to dictate what songs I can listen to or when
or in what order. I like to rip specific songs from CDs then make
my own CD, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to
my truck. The master CD is saved and rarely played (""why"" is
explained later in this message). I prefer making my own CDs for
my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my CDs
stolen, it would be much easier to replace a self-burned CD than a
master. Sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large
expense, if at all.
If the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not
available anywhere, then yes, I do believe in it. Or, if the song
being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, I
do believe in that, too. Case in point: as a kid, I collected a
lot of 45s and record albums. I have more than 4,000 records in my
collection. Many were played so much that they are not playable
anymore and, even though I did take care of them, due to the cheap
stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' I want to
relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to
convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me.
So, in this instance, no, I do not think it is illegal to seek out
digitalized copies of the old songs that I already have records of
(albums and/or 45s). If, however, the song(s) that I am seeking
are available on CD, then I will be very quick to purchase that CD
from Tower Records, The Warehouse, or any other reputable dealer.
For those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one
day, perhaps I will reach a point with technology (and money)
where I can transfer those platters to WAV and they will sound as
good as when they were originally recorded. I have been lucky
enough to find some on CD thanks to the Internet; I was quick to
purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves.
Some of the music that I have, sadly, will never be heard again. I
blame RIAA and the recording industry for that, too. Neither seem
to care about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered CDs are
released.

Who can save you from making a small oversight with your digital
video camera purchase? Lockergnomie Frank Kenna: ""I see that
you're thinking of getting a DV camera. I got one about a month
ago, and I made one mistake: I didn't get one with A/V INPUTS.
Mine has A/V outputs, which are great for getting your digital
stuff out onto VHS, etc. But without the inputs, there's no way to
get VHS or old 8mm footage into the camera. With inputs, not only
can you get your old 8mm & VHS stuff onto DV tapes, but you can
use the camera as a pass-through device and get the old stuff
directly onto your computer for editing purposes. I wish someone
had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when I
bought my DV camcorder. The reviews and magazines I read barely
mentioned this feature - and nobody stressed its importance. But
if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you
want to work on any of your old stuff). Don't make the same
mistake I did - make SURE you get this feature. It doesn't seem to
impact the price of the cameras; some offer it and some don't.""
This advice came not a moment too soon for me. Thank you for
helping us, Frank!

Well you are right, sorry, I didn't have any better idea yesterday late in

The fonts are ugly only inside of gnome2 and clean for gnome1 apps, if
antialiasing is disabled. 
This is difficult to understand for me.

M:A, for some reason, changes its base class depending on whether the

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If

MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.
Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
""nomime"" => 1?

"DEAR SIR,
I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on 
the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will 
be of
great assistance to each other likewise 
developing a
cordial relationship.
I currently have within my reach the sum of 
thirty
six million United States Dollars 
(US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment 
purposes
specifically in your country. This money came 
as a
result of a payback contract deal between my 
late
husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with 
my
late husband's security company in Nigeria of 
which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian 
government
have intensified their probe on my husband's 
financial
resources and they have revoked our licenses 
that
allows us to own a financial and oil company. 
In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and 
deposited
it in a privately erected security safe abroad.
No record ever existed concerning the money 
neither is
the money traceable by the Government because 
there is
no documentation showing that we received the 
money
from the Russians.
Due to the current situation in the country 
concerning
Government attitude towards my family, it has 
become
quite impossible for me to make use of this 
money
within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this 
money
into your safe bank account. On your consent, I 
shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed 
to
transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 
20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services 
and
assistance. Your urgent response is highly 
needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent 
should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m@ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this 
opportunity to implore you to exercise the most 
utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I 
await your
prompt response.
Best personal regards,
MRS MARIAM ABACHA.

"PRESS RELEASE FROM THE AYN RAND INSTITUTE
2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606
July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET
       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.
       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""
       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.
       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""
       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""
###   ###   ###
Ayn Rand Institute executive director Dr. Yaron Brook is available for
interviews on this topic.
Contact: Larry Benson

CAREER SERVICES FROM LOCKERGNOME AND DICE.COM:
We've teamed up with
Dice.com to bring you a full service I.T. career enhancement solution.
Whether you are looking for your
dream job
or trying to
hire talented people
,
the full-featured career resource center is the place to start. Find your
IT talent solution
today!
I've got a few quick Lockergnome-related notes for you today.
First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience
Gnomedex
last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, ""The show of the year."" It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of
registration
, it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.
Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right.
Jake
has release a
FREE
GnomeTome
on ""Converting Vinyl LPs to CD."" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - ""Gnome"" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.
Have a great Tuesday.

Setting the Home Page in Konqueror
Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web
and
file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.
Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/
user
directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.
Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select ""Configure Konqueror,"" and leave the default selection of ""File Manager"" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the ""Home URL"" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.
Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select ""Window"" and ""Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'"" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.
Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.

Kernel Configuration - Part XII
Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for ""Redundant Array of Independent Discs"" or ""Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs."" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.
Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.
Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.
RAID-0 ""stripes"" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.
RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0,
does
provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is ""mirrored"" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.
RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for
parity
information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data
can
be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.
RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a ""spare disc"" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.
With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.
Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.

Windows Apps in Linux?
Scribbled by Robert Nix
""Nice coverage but I don't give a flip about Office. OpenOffice is fine
for my needs.
""What I really want is to run Quicken (at least v.2001) which is the only
app keeping me running Windows (using vmware). I've tried Quicken on Mac
OS X and it is grossly inadequate and on Linux with Wine and have so far
been unsuccessful even using tips from
http://appdb.codeweavers.com/appview.php?appId=107. I hope that GnuCash
will eventually support the online features I enjoy but that doesn't
help now.
""The reason I'm writing this is that I personally think Office products
are overrated for home users, at least now that there are several native
alternatives. For home users, finance apps are the key issue now. Do a

Important Unix Manpages
http://home.ins.de/~m.hussmann/man/
Manpages are an important part of Linux use. Armed with the proper knowledge and manpage, there are few sticky situations in Linux that can't be solved quickly. Though they can be a bit cryptic at times, manpages are really a Linux newbie's best friend.
Important Unix Manpages is a compilation of help for situations that actually have little to do with programming. They're more human interface problems than machine interface problems. This page just points out that if life was like Linux, we'd all be a lot happier.

"This is my Netscape 7.0 Review.
o They finally got the email search speed back up to
   where it was in 4.7.x
o Setting up user mail accounts doesn't have that really
   odd, sometimes it lets me sometimes it doesn't problem that
   previous versions had.
o I still have to manually update all my address books by
   hand but at least it lets me import them as Netscape 4.x
   address books (there's not 6.x import as they just assume
   it works--which it doesn't)
o The mail filters are still broken and have the same problem that
   I've tried to report since 4.0.2 where you can't store a mail
   filter of the type: Age in days, is greater than, 21 (or some number)
   Gawd I'd really wish they'd fix that freakin' bug, it's the single
   biggest annoyance that I have with Netscape as it's one of the
   most effective anti-spam tools that I have.
o Webex doesn't support Netscape 7.0 and the plugin doesn't
   work which causes problems when you want to use Webex to
   work on something with someone remotely.
I've given up trying to report bugs and any changes to the
source I send always get lost.

"I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting exmh
windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis SSH
X11 forwarding).  In fact, your message was read and replied to (this
message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home
machine.
Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 
I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.
That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
exmh working on the same set of folders.
It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
so bad that I can't stand it.

I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham.  I
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.
I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.
Heh. I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first
started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.
course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. 
Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.com
DEAR SIR
 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL.
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. 
We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.
Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry 
of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board
appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria to award contracts to individuals and
companies and to approve such contract payments in the
Ministry of Mines and Power. The duties of the
committee also include evaluation, vetting and
monitoring of work done by foreign and local
contractors in the ministry.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 
The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 
However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 
The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.
We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped 
in the circumstances as the civil service code of
conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore
accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction. 
My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not want
to miss this once in a life time opportunity.
You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 
(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 
(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 
(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 
(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 
Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of  receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 
Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email
address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into
the
complete picture of the transaction when I have heard
from you. 
Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 
Thank you and God bless. 
Yours faithfully, 
Mr Joe Mark

Your sysadmins are wrong.
Whatever program that is used to store the mail into the 
braindead ""mailbox"" file (/var/spool/mail/whatever) is supposed 
to escape a line that begins with From.  That program is called 
the local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
It would be better if you never, ever, stored your mail in a 
""mailbox"" file.
If your sysadmins are capable of it, get them to set up the 
receiving Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to allow the use of procmail 
as the local MDA.  Then use procmail to invoke rcvstore and 
deliver your mail directly into your MH mail folders.
Most Linux systems come configured this way, if a user has a
$HOME/.procmail file then mail is delivered using procmail.

There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the
hundred-thousand-hectares).
It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural
curiousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of
the world. Maybe they're downloading Bjork videos.

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.
The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.
According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.
""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.
In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.
""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.
The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.
DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.
========================================================================
DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.
DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.
DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.
""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.
""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""
""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X
   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
   soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on

   CAPTAIN FTP
   Version: 1.3
   File size: 793K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X
   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
   book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:

   AQUILACALENDAR
   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X
   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

   you check out Tex-Edit Plus. This handy little editor offers
   all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands,
   translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,
   and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be
   able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client

   Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
   from. Blast away:

"If you are a time traveler or alien disguised as human and or have

My life has been severely tampered with and cursed!!
I have suffered tremendously and am now dying!
I need to be able to:
Travel back in time.
Rewind my life including my age back to 4.
I am in very great danger and need this immediately!
I am aware of two types of time travel one in physical form and 
the other
in energy form where a snapshot of your brain is taken using 
either the
dimensional warp or the carbon copy replica device and then sends 
your consciousness
back through time to part with your younger self. Please explain
how safe and what your method involves.
I have a time machine now, but it has limited abilitys and is 
useless
without
a vortex.
If you can provide information on how to create vortex generator 
or
where I can get some of the blue glowing moon crystals this would 
also
be helpful. I am however concerned with the high level of 
radiation these
crystals give off, if  you could provide a shielding that would be 
great.
I believe the vortex needs to be east-west polarized,
North-south polarized vortexexs are used for cross-dimensional 
time 
travel only.

"Hello
 
You may have seen this business before and
ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!
 
With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!
 
I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling.
 
I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.
 
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
 
Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.
 
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! 
=================================================BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
 
Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.
 
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely 
NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if 
people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to 
make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".
 
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.
 
This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00

=================================================Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the 
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
 
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
 
FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!
 
INSTRUCTIONS:
 
=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ==== 
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
 
===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE =====YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ==You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.
 
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.
 
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it.
 
Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 
This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.
 
1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement 
and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This 
person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting 
their fortune.
 
2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 
3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 
4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 
5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.
 
PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.
 
=================================================**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.
 
Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:
 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY 
================================================= 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.
 
Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.
 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
 
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
 
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
 
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! 
================================================= 
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?
 
There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!
 
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET 
================================================= 
Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.
 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.
 
===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ===================The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.
 
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
 
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
 
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for
Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.
 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks
after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.
 
** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.
 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS
AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!! 
================================================FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with
NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can
make more money in the next few weeks and months
than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.
It works exceedingly well as it is now.
 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report
after you have put your name and address in
Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as
instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them.
 
Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.
 
IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
 
=============MORE TESTIMONIALS==============""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work.
 
Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""
 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois 
===============================================""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks.
 
The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""
 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada 
================================================""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. 
================================================""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software
Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.
Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.
In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.
Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.
On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).
Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest
San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.
Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.
In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!
Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.
Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.
The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans
Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.
When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm

Hi,
First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week,
but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this!
- Is this with different DVDs or a single one?
- Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both?
- Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?
I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading
libdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.

GET WINDOWS XP TIPS:
Months after the release of Windows XP Professional and Home editions, people are still learning the nuances of Microsoft's newest operating system. Whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new OS soon, this ebook is right up your alley.

This is of course belated, as I'm sending it on the 18th, but Happy Birthday to Lori!
One thing about MacWorld should excite mp3 junkies -- the iPod just got 
even bigger, with a 20GB version and Apple officially endorses Windows 
compatibility. Actually, the good news is, the 5GB and 10GB versions 
came down in price. Hearing that the only ""officially"" functional 
Windows player is MusicMatch Jukebox Plus is a serious downer, in my 
opinion. Sure, MusicMatch is a decent player, but with plenty of great 
free players on the market, why do we want to purchase a software 
player in addition to the $299+ hardware unit?
At first glance, it looks like Apple is only paying lipservice to true 
Windows compatibility. I've seen no mention of any additional 
functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. Mediafour's
XPlay
remains a 
better option, in my opinion. In addition to allowing you to use an 
iPod with almost any media player made for Windows, it assists with

Lori and I made the five and a half hour drive to St. Louis for this year's

without a hitch. I just missed a 
face-to-face introduction to John Lal, of
winferno.com

we'll meet tomorrow. John's the guy behind the
free copy of Research-Desk

what the future holds.
Every time I travel, I'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. Fortunately, my
Crosspaths.net
connection allows me 
to send mail via my Lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup 
services. Crosspaths is technically an Iowa ISP, although the have points of 
presence in almost every major city in the country. If you're a dialup user, 
you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. Lori 
has used their DSL service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of 
outstanding in dealing with customer service queries.

PNG Files Do Not Show Transparency in Internet Explorer (Q294714)
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q294714
This originally appeared in last weeks Webmaster Weekly, but due to its graphical nature, its worth inclusion here as well:
""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""
Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

Unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of 
selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on CD for the price 
of shipping and handling. All CDs are professionally mastered works, 
so you're getting label quality releases, without the jacked-up retail 
price tag. The mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. 
The only thing I find odd about this site is their proclamation of 
paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which I have to assume is 
50% of zero, since the CDs are free. The artist selection contains 
some solid releases by talented artists, regardless.

Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
(NR) 1966
Adapted Play - 131min
Reviewer's Tilt (10)
Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play ""Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?""  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes ""Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?""  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.

Sitescooper: scoop websites onto your PalmPilot
Sitescooper automatically retrieves the stories from several news websites, trims    off extraneous HTML, and converts them into iSilo or Palm DOC format for later    reading on-the-move. It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've already    read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2- and 3-level sites as well    as My-Netscape-style RSS sites. It's also very easy to add a new site to its list.    Even if you don't have a PalmPilot, it's still handy for simple website-to-text    conversion. Site files are included for many popular news sites including Slashdot,    LWN, Freshmeat and Linux Today.

REACH A MILLION
Here is what you get:
1. We will continue to list your site in the TopSites directories.
2. We will show your listing more than a million times a year (guaranteed).
Let us introduce you (a million times!)
People often ask, ""How can you guarantee to show my listing a million times? What if I am in an unpopular category?"" It does not matter! Why? AutoSearch--our patent pending tool--continually displays renewed TopSites-us listings on our users PCs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We display TopSites-us listings more than 42 million times in an hour. That is why we can guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year. 
Save $40,000 in adverting 
It would cost you up to $40,000 to display your listing a million times at sites like MSN and Altavista. Googles charges up to $200,000 depending on your category. At TopSites we charge $5 a month!
Save $100 re-listing fee
Please do not let your listing expire. Our editors listed you as one of the top websites in your category without charge. If your listing expires, however, you may need to pay a $100 editorial review fee to get listed again. It can take a month for our editors to authorize a listing. And they may not re-list you if there are too many listings in your category. 
Only TopSites-us gives you: 
* Massive Reach: We display our listings billions of times a year. We guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year.
* Cost-Effectiveness: This is the least expensive advertising you will ever buy. You want to bring lots of potential customers to your site in a cost-effective way. TopSites-us does exactly that! 
* Highly Targeted Leads: TopSites-us reaches customers when they are searching for what you are selling. That means high sales and low costs. More visitors become customers! 
* Highest Return on Investment: Independent research confirms that you get the highest ROI from online listings like TopSites-us. E-mail, banners and other forms of online advertising all have a lower ROI. And unlike direct mail, you pay nothing for mailing lists, printing or postage. No media buy returns better results than TopSites-us. 
* No-Risk: Cancel your listing any time for any reason--no questions asked!
* Hassle-Free: Change your listing anytime or even move it to a different category--for free--and your changes will instantly appear in the directory

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Can I change my listing?
You can change your listing now or later. You can rewrite the headline and description before renewing. You can change the URL tooeven to another website. 
Once we receive payment, we will send you instructions on how to change your listing whenever you like. (Theres no charge to do this.)
Can I change my category? 
Can I list my site in additional categories?
Can I list other sites too?
You can list as many sites in as many categories as you like. Each listing costs only $5 per month per category. Just go to www.topsitez.us. Click on the category links until you find the one you want (or search on your keywords). Click on the Add My Site link. Then type your listing. If your old listing was in the wrong category, you can click unsubscribe to cancel it.
How much does a listing cost?
Can I renew for free?
It costs $5 a month to list your site in TopSites. We no longer offer any free listings. We will bill you $60 for 12 months. There are no additional costs. You can change your listing as often as you like for free. You can cancel your listing anytime and we will refund your remaining money.
How do I pay? 
You can pay with a U.S. check, money order or bank draft. Or you can pay by Visa, MasterCard or American Express. Simply select the option you prefer on the renewal form. (Unfortunately, we cannot cash overseas checks at this time.)
Who listed us?
When did our listing start?
We do not know. Sorry. We only began to track listing contacts and dates this year.
How much did we pay to be listed? 
Originally you couldnt buy a listing--you had to wait for our editors to select you as one of the top sites in your category.
Do we have a contract with you?
We dont ask our customers to sign contracts for a $5 a month service.
Can you call me and tell me more?
We are happy to answer all your questions by email but we dont contact our customer by phone at this time. Sorry.
Can I still renew after your deadline?
We give our customers a month to renew so dont worry too much about the deadline.
How do I see my listing? I couldnt find it when I searched.
You can go to www.topsitez.us and click on the categories until you get to /Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Linux/Projects/Internet.
You can also see it at www.topsitez.us by entering two or more keywords from your listing into our search form. Since we have more than three million listings, you probably wont find your listing by searching on only one word. And you definitely wont find it if you search on words that are not in your listing. 
What keywords display my listing? 
How do I change them?
Every word in your listing is a keyword. Anytime someone searches on two or more words in your listing, we will display it. The only way to change your keywords is to change the headline or description of your listing.
How much traffic did you send us last year?
We dont know. Sorry. We are working on adding this feature.

Ah, sorry for not making that clearer.
But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point whi
     le
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.

Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue

acting as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely
turning off catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor
with the -rs option, please take it out and let the agents discover a
closeby catalogue server.

surprised if that happens soon. I'm sure you'd welcome a female
perspective on this stuff, right? She helped one of our landlords
pick a paint color for the ""office"" wall this evening. Does that
qualify her to talk about cool stuff that we find for you on the
Internet? You betcha. Let's see how she does with the drapes and
rugs. I have a feeling I'll be the one tweaking furniture layout.
Shouldn't be too much of an issue - yet. I wonder if Ikea has an
affiliate program?
I've mentioned how Yahoo Mail's beta is mangling our commas, but
did you know that it's also (possibly) rewriting your e-mail? If
you send an HTML message to someone who has a yahoo.com account,
something may get lost in the translation. Try sending this
sentence: ""My medieval mocha has an expression to evaluate.""
Again, be sure this note is sent in HTML format. The results will
surprise you. As far as I can tell, they're doing this to stop any
scripts from being distributed to their user base. I must credit
Marion Schroll for making me aware of the ""problem."" It's kinda
funny, in a weird sort of way. Not that I would want anything I
send changed in any way, shape, or form. It begs the question:
what next? I mean, where does it all stop? Give them a bit, and
they just might take a byte. Censorship is only a stone's throw
away.
I really feel for Lockergnomie Sharon Clark, who asks: ""What is
this crazy business with the broadband metering? What they
advertise doesn't seem to be what you get. Now that I'm forking
out $60 per month for a supposed metered rate of 640 down / 320
up, I'm feeling clueless and left out in the cold. Not sure what
I'm paying for, not sure what's going on at the office, not sure
if I'm capped, not sure if I'm getting ripped off! Can you help me
out here? I'm feeling lied to; why can't I download 'til my 40 gig
is full? That is what they promised me and that is what I THOUGHT
I was paying for. I want consistent speed - is this too much to
ask?"" It's not too much to ask the question, but it's probably too
much to get the answer. I'm facing the same dilemma right now,
even though cable-based connectivity isn't available in my area.
Expect more and more ""filters"" to be put in place as time marches
on. Watch those EULAs, folks.
See You in

Directory Lister v0.5.2 [547k] W9x/2k/XP FREE
http://freeware.prv.pl/
{List directory contents} When I was younger, I'd get so frustrated at those games where you'd have to pick out all of the subtle differences between two pictures. I'd always end up with one or two that I just could never see. When I want to do the same type of comparison between two directories on my computer, I use Directory Lister and I never miss a thing. Not only does Directory Lister display the contents of your chosen directories, it will also let you save the output to an HTML file. This is great for web developers who want a quick way to list the contents of a ZIP file before archiving it and uploading it to their website. As an added bonus, Directory Lister also shows the date, time, and attributes of the files in your directory, making it easier than ever to compare the differences in files between two directories.
Web Calendar [25k] W2k/XP FREE
http://members.lycos.co.uk/bleucanard/WebCalendar.htm
{Web page reminder} Surfing the web as much as I do, I'll occasionally run into a site or page that commits the horrendous faux pas of displaying an ""Under Construction"" banner. I COULD forget about the site and maybe somehow encounter it later, or I COULD drop the site into Web Calendar and have this handy-dandy app remind me to check the page again in a week. The same technique holds true for my normal browsing... for example, I can use Web Calendar to remind me to check out the Digital Media newsletter every morning, or to check Amazon for a CD that I know will be released in a week. Now, I will have no excuse for missing the DVD release of ""Lord of the Rings""...

CollegeBAR v8.0 [5.9M] W9x/2k/XP US$20
Unearthed by Shawn Verrall
http://www.pracx.com/collegebar.asp
{Mix your own drinks} When I was in college, my room used to be known as ""The Bar."" It may have had something do with my L-shaped desk that resembled a bar, and the fact that I had seen the movie Cocktail too many times and wanted to be a bottle-flipping bartender. I never achieved my goal of being the world's best geek bartender, but maybe with College Bar I could have. College Bar contains recipes for over 11,600 drinks. With an online update feature, you can download new drinks as they become available... or you can add your own creative concoctions to the database! College Bar also has a calculator to determine someone's blood alcohol level... drink responsibly, folks. As an added bonus, you can load some of your favorite party pictures into the program and you'll see a slide show of those pictures - a great way to remember the good times... unless you don't remember experiencing them in the first place, that is. Dude, where's my car?

GnomeTIP
I am a sucker for keyboard shortcuts. Anything that can save me from using the mouse is good in my book. Occasionally I like to view the web or Windows Explorer in Full Screen mode... to do this I just hit F11 on the keyboard and there I am in Full Screen mode. Hit it again and I am back to regular mode. If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen. Never fear, another keyboard shortcut is here... just press Ctrl key plus the Esc key and your Start Menu will be back where it belongs. Alternatively, if you have a Windows key on your keyboard you can use that key to bring up your Start Menu as well.

Dear Readers,
With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us, who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message Boards. The
CNET Message Boards
are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question 
in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

Why I don't use firewalls
Do you need some honest opinions? Despite all the horror stories that you hear of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open.

The scoop on USB 2.0
The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

"I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  
After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. 
I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in
""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""
If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and
why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income
.
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between
200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt
. For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.
With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.
The income potential is substantial in this profession.
We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year
.
Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.
Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
Quote's from several of our students:
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.
My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
.Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.
You have the video opened doors for me in the future.
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us:
""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week
and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months""
From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:
With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
Please call us at 1-281-500-4018
.
We have Service Support
staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week
. If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.
Thank you for your time and interest.

LESSON 2: COMPANIES GONE WRONG
Instructors: Bill Mann, TMF Otter (with Matt Richey, TMF Matt)
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690055
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690056
In Lesson 1, we offered a list of red flags that trigger instant
sales. These things are pretty easy to spot, if you keep up with
current events surrounding the companies you hold.
Notice that we didn't spend much (meaning any) time discussing
Wall Street analyst upgrades or downgrades. This is for one
reason: We don't care what analysts think, and we certainly
don't put any credence in their deeply compromised ratings systems.
Sure, we read analyst research. After all, many analysts have
significantly more access to business management than we ever
will as individual investors, so they can have some valuable
insights. But if you want to watch a much better predictor of
company trouble than analyst rating systems, watch the bond
market (more on this later). ""Strong buy?"" Pfffffft.
In this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is
slipping. Investors need to remember one key point: For highly
valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large
share price decline. For example, a company priced at a multiple
of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is
priced at 15 times. As a result, investors in the high-multiple
company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business
starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows,
whatever). Thus, with highly valued companies in particular,
it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. Even a
company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals.
So let's look at a few instances where companies have started to
go wrong. Our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning
signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens.
WARNING SIGN 1: SLOWING SALES GROWTH
Through 2000, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) could do no wrong. It was one of
the fastest-growing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best
capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the
market: wireless telecommunications. In 2000, Nokia posted
revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. Then, in April
2001, it hit a clunker -- 22% growth, followed by 5% growth the
next quarter. For investors in a high-multiple (high P/E)
company, this is rough. For most companies, a second quarter in
a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. Get out. For a
barnburner like Nokia, one is enough.
Some words of wisdom: Keep companies in one of the hottest
sectors on a very short leash. Hot sectors cool off -- they
always do. Remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then
canals, car companies, radios, and so on. It ends. Be ready. If
you're expecting sales to continue roaring full-steam ahead and
they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell
trigger. If sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give
a company one quarter to bring up its performance. But unload on
the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a
year-over-year basis. (Always compare the quarterly growth on a
year-over-year basis -- a comparison of sequential quarterly
growth is a worthless measure. Seasonal effects can skew
sequential growth.)
WARNING SIGN 2: DIVERGENT SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH
By April 2001, Nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. Signs
were surely evident in advance, right? Why, yes. Companies
growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom
lines (earnings) at a similar clip. Even though Nokia's sales
were growing through 2000 at 50%-plus per quarter, at the end
of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70%
to 40%.
Profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to
collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. The economics
changed quickly, and with a hyper-growth company, the stock
reacted just as fast. Even those not deeply versed in the
technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see
signs that something was wrong.
WARNING SIGN 3: PLUMMETING CASH FLOWS
In 1999, Lucent (NYSE: LU) looked beautiful from an earnings
perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. We look
at two numbers: operating cash flow and free cash flow. Free
cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have
significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash
flow is inexcusable. Lucent's experiences are telling. In 1999,
Lucent's full-year earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion,
based upon $38 billion in revenue. The company was on top of the
world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications
equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690057
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690058
But as Matt and I detailed in January 2000, big troubles were
afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. On an
operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost
$276 million. That's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in
reported net income. And on top of that, Lucent had more than
$2.2 billion in capital expenditures. Thus, the difference
between Lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating
cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3
billion, and not in a good way.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690059
The investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have
saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (As an aside, since 1999,
Lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but
twice, and in the most recent 10-K, the 1999 operating cash flow
is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.)
And get this -- you'll see nearly the exact same thing on
Enron's old financial statements. Cooked books or no, they
weren't generating much cash. In fact, they were destroying it.
WARNING SIGN 4: WATCH THOSE BONDS
Remember what we said about ignoring analysts? Well, it's
because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's
almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best
interests in mind. Fortunately, another group can give you the
same type of signals: investors who hold a company's bonds.
Bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally
paid interest on this obligation by the company. Watch the
current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds
bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. I
recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of
the bond. Download it here. If you see a drop, the bondholders
are growing pessimistic. You might even see this at the same
time analysts are shouting, ""Strong buy!""
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690060
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690061
I recommend the Yahoo! Bond Center. You can search on any company
and get a list of existing bonds. Find a bond with a maturity
between five and 10 years hence. Check the price. A bond priced
at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's face-value
interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. Some
bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be
lower than face value. These are considered to be very low risk.
But some are priced below face value, even way below.
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690062
As of this writing, WorldCom (Nasdaq: WCOME) bonds are priced at
18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance
they'll be paid. Tyco (NYSE: TYC), for all of its recent
problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with
2011 maturity priced at 83. That's a discount to face, but not
one that alludes to an imminent default. Qwest (NYSE: Q) sports
a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than
Tyco. These prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they
don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either.
WARNING SIGN 5: ""IT JUST DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER""
For a brief time in 2000, Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) was the
largest company in the world by market capitalization. This
should have been a warning. As I wrote in May 2000 when the
stock was around $57, Cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion
implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach
$34 billion in 2010. Yet no company had ever generated earnings
higher than $12 billion in a single year.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690063
As it turned out, I almost perfectly called the top for Cisco --
it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that
article. Only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any
better achieved a sale near the high watermark. Cisco showed no
signs of a decline. For the quarter that ended Jan. 29, 2000,
Cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8
billion for the same quarter the year before -- a growth rate of
53%. The following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then
66% higher.
Only Cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. Imagine
a $385 billion company with a P/E of 156! The assumptions for
future growth were mind-bending, though at the time, in the
midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. As
investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities.
Taking a portion of our Cisco investment off the table, at this
point, would've been a smart choice. Remember, Cisco's business
was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot
has to be right for the situation to work out.
HOMEWORK
For this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after
Lesson 1. Pick a company -- maybe even the same company you
looked at last time -- to continue studying. For your company,
do the following:
- Track the year-over-year sales growth for each of the past four
  quarters and three fiscal years. Is growth accelerating,
  staying about the same, or weakening?
- Track the year-over-year net income growth for each of the past
  four quarters and three fiscal years. Is net income growing
  slower or faster than sales? Is there a trend to these figures?
- Track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past
  three fiscal years. Is it lower or higher than reported net
  income for the corresponding year? (We're not having you look
  at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around
  due to the timing of payments. Annual cash flow data is much
  more indicative of real cash flow trends.)
- If your company has long-term debt, go the Yahoo! Bond Center
  and check the price of your company's bonds. (If you don't know
  whether your company has any debt, just type your company name
  into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)
  http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690064
- Finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its
  current net income over the past year. What's the P/E ratio? Is
  there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario
  already priced into its stock? (In the current bear market,
  this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's
  still a question you should consider.)

"Hi all,
I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)
I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)
Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
- Install the ""alsa-utils"" package
Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)
Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.
With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!
It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).
I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.
  http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html
But Colossus was not for Enigma. The bombes used for Enigma were
electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques
to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified. And
clearly, the first bulk breaks of Enigma were done by the bombes, so I
guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this
statement has any credibility at all.

================================================================ASK THE FOOL
Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 
A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. 
Full Answer:
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562069
-----------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR MONEY 
RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070
Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 
1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 
2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072
3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073
4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074
5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562075
If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it 
alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your 
finances with TMF Money Advisor. In fact, we're so excited about 
this service, we are offering a free one-month trial 
subscription. For more information, go here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHT
SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 
We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.
Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562078
-----------------------------------------------------------------
COMMUNITY TIPS
DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 
-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 
-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 
-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 
-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.
-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 
-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 
Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day,
constantly polling for mail. If they go away for a long weekend,
lots of ""friday night spam"" will become ham on sunday night.
(Friday night seems to be the most popular time)
So we'll make this a config parameter.

Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular
email clients"".. As a stop-gap to the auto-ham ..
What's an auto-ham?
How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham
folder. Most email clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to
quickly move ""spam"" into the spam folder.
I personally don't think IMAP has a bright future, but for people who
do use it, that's certainly a good approach.
Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete
function) they can quickly move ham into the ham folder.
Yes.

"That's what the manual said - a diversity antenna.
Why wouldn't it work well with one omni and one directional antena?

I think what you're looking at with the dual antenna mounts is a 
diversity antenna.  It won't work too well with one hooked up to the 
pringles can and the other hooked up to a regular rubber duck.

Ready for this?<br>
<br>
The next five months could determine whether<br> 
TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service,<br>
ultimately survives as a business.<br>
<br>
TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less <br>
than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock<br>
dipped below three this week. And network execs<br>
are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>
which permits skipping commercials with a few <br>
clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>
models. There even have been hints that the <br>
networks could support a move by the cable <br>
industry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>
commercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>
be a TiVo. <br>
<br>
To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>
at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>
reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>
recommended the service to a friend. And when<br>
people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>
like the way people say ""Coke"" when they talk<br>
about soft drinks. )<br>
<br>
But Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>
are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>
putting some big numbers on the board -- <br>
and it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>
it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>
until now will run for the hills. That will push<br>
the company's stock price down even further. And<br>
if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>
Sell the company under duress or wait until its <br>
funding dries up. <br>
<br>
Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>
an intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>
five months, right through the holiday season.<br>
The blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>
retail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>
efforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>
Street -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>
the brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>
needs to show that it can generate<br>
mass consumer demand. <br>
<br>
How does TiVo demonstrate that?<br>
<br>
Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end<br>
will have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>
the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>
TiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>
service is not such a great selling point <br>
after all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>
not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>
to stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>
its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>
(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>
but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>
the merger is approved.) <br>
<br>
So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme<br>
to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided<br>
in the next several months. <br>
<br>
Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>
a partial success. The company will boost its <br>
subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>
as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>
also predict it will decide to sell the company<br>
to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>
even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>
necessary funding and industry connections<br>
for long-term growth and survival.<br>

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes 
the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater 
performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the 
first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based 
startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data 
between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the 
file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach 
the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with 
regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that 
he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes 
of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 
1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large 
collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the 
markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and 
will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an 
application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators 
more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging 
market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega 
XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, 
launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at 
$54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=============================================================> ==========> 
DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs 
since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry 
interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was 
a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML 
processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own 
products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team 
raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built 
hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first 
versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing 
industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital 
Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital 
and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, 
of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, 
marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware 
networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and 
transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web 
services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed 
processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s 
critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of 
performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load 
balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology 
addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing 
the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. 
""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, 
DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for 
enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

Something like that is quite possible, but perviously typing nonsense

from the sequence code...
Perviously this would have just caused red messages in the status

Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.
That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

 a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is

company
 abroad at the
peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my
country few
 years ago. Now
the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person
like you to
 proceed to
the place of the security company in order to clear
the fund and
 invest on
my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.
 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will
 enable 
you take possesion of the the fund for onward
investment for our
 mutual 
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:
1. A letter of committment (duely signed) that you

2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your international identity or driving licence

Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
By Andrew Marshall
BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.
""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
knew then there was something special.""
Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
who is expecting their first child.
Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
in search of a wife.
""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""
Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
the couple married.
MR. MARRIAGE
Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
agency.
Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.
""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
knowledge, they have all been successful.""
Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.
Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
language problems.
""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""
After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
client has found a potential wife.
""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
usually within the next year.
Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
than 10 percent have broken up.
Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.
""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
down, OK, we'll talk.""'
But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
stress disorder.
WHY?
Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.
But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
need Wan,"" he said.
""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
their future husband.""
Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
choose to use his agency.
His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
not ""God's gift to women.""
Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.
""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
Impossible,"" she said.
""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ladies from other countries.""
Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
not a major obstacle.
""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
very quickly.""
Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
to the West.
""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
how to eat, and when to make tea.""
PITFALLS
But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
back in Bangkok, sad and angry.
""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
spoke to me.""
Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""
Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
unsuitable candidates are weeded out.
""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
comers.""
Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
looking for a foreign husband.
""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""",0,0

It is a bit slow loading as would be the case with so much animation.I guess it will always be slow with all that. I do not like pop up pages and therewas one that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimation did not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeen put into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,why don't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~This is a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funas well. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name anda host that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm... too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlike the wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedme for a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someof the links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbased or smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhere to go.~~~~This was a neat site.  The site was original and I could tell that Mrs. T certainlyseems to enjoy working on her site.  The graphics were pretty, or funny,depending on each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewas going from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedthe left rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.  Also, I thinkusing a sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did like howthe font color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.I don't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage, it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactive opinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothe site content helps when new visitors visit.On your home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.If you do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferent pictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepicture on each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website. Onyour articles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseof the background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehind that would work better.Look for a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepages but I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.I went to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is much easierto deal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~This is an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not all of whichI visited - and it has something for every member of the family, however, mostof it is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play - goodfor smaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and I wouldrecommend this site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTE ON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Help out the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOUR favorite!You can help out Teddy at http://www.links4profit.com by taking alook at his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBay Designs http://AkkaBay.com has designed specificallyfor him.

"" 11 Access Points, Home Gateways and Ethernet bridging
Most Access Points act as a MAC level bridge, allowing the Wireless LAN to 
be a natural extension of a wired network. They are deployed in a cellular 
fashion, and provide extended security, management and roaming.
On the other hand, the Home Gateways allow a single cell to be connected to 
a WAN, like a modem, a cable modem or a DSL access. The set of features is 
quite different, and they offer NAT/masquerading and PPP configuration.
The conventional Ethernet bridging method (promiscuous sniffing) doesn't 
work with most wireless LAN standard, because of the header encapsulation 
and the interactions with link layer retransmissions. In other word, most 
often, when you use a software bridge on a wireless LAN (such as the Linux 
bridge on a 802.11 card), it doesn't work (moreover, quite often promiscuous 
is broken as well). ""
[[ What the?? What is he talking about?? Aren't we all using Linux to bridge 
our networks? ]]
"" The driver could work around this restriction by creating its own MAC 
headers (802.11 headers instead of 802.3, and putting the right bits in the 
right place), but in fact most vendors don't provide the specification on 
how to this with their hardware (when they don't explicitely prevent it in 
hardware, to force you to buy their Access Points).
In other words, don't expect to use your Linux PC as a wireless bridge or 
wireless Access Points with most products out there, and forget about 
turning it into an Access Point. Of course, there is some exceptions. ""
[[ Is this true? ]]
"" The workaround is to set the wireless LAN in ad-hoc mode and to use other 
methods, such as routing, masquerading, IP bridging, ARP proxying... ""
[[ Yes, I am in a process of building a wireless-lan <-> wired-lan bridge. 
But I don't understand what this guy is talking about. Anyone?
Vince. ]]

It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
videos will come, never fear.

First order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
external
DSL
modem
in a few days. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites?
There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: ""If the
hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
uplink."" How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd

Print! v1.6 [319k] W9x/2k/XP US$39
Unearthed by Rob Muller
http://www.robsoftware.com/
{Screen print utility} Time is money, and I endorse any program
that can save me time. Luckily, that is exactly what Print! v1.6
does. Say that I want to share screenshots with my other tech
friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes:
every time I take a screen shot, I open up Word, paste the
snapshot, and THEN I can print it. Too many steps, too much of my
time! With Print!, I just hit my ""Print Screen"" key and out comes
my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!
Other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to
invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
on toner. Bonus!)  You may also want to note that Print! saves
your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth
with this program. Don't believe me? Start by checking out the

GnomeTIP
Any modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
""Winmodem."" Most manufacturers use ""Winmodems"" because they are
cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
with the way ""Winmodems"" function after you add more internal
devices to your PC. ""Winmodems"" rely on Windows to mediate their
serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
run Linux instead? Will the ""Winmodem"" function well, if at all,
in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the
modem says it REQUIRES Windows, then keep looking... you've found
yourself a ""Winmodem."" However, if the system requirements for the
modem say that it will work with Linux, then you've found yourself
a hardware modem. Yes, it IS that easy.

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. &#8220;Microsoft has redesigned. 
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; 
The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. 
Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. 
Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. Want to find the search box? That's &#8220;1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans 
dot gif search for 1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans dot gif form edit box 1pttrans dot 
gif submit button go 1pttrans dot gif link advanced search 1pttrans dot gif 
...&#8221; And I hope you weren't looking for Microsoft's accessibility home 
page[5]; it's the 76th link on the page (out of 76).

Techs fall with consumer sentiment
A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.
Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.
Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.
Rivals help improve Dell's outlook
Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals.
The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.
DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39%
Lukewarm response to Juniper moves
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.
JUNIPER NETWORKS 7.70 6.65%
Asia proves sweet spot for Yahoo
Web portal Yahoo, which broke a long streak of losses in the second quarter, said it hopes to ride on Asia's acceptance of online advertising and focus on wireless content to boost its regional business.
""Asian advertisers who use traditional media like newspapers and TV are moving more into online ads as they see the value and efficiency that it delivers,"" Niren Hiro, Yahoo's general manager for Southeast Asia, said in an interview Thursday. ""That's why we've seen in the last quarter clients who have traditionally stayed away from new media like us starting to divert their budgets in our direction.""

J.P. Morgan downgrades Powerwave Technologies to ""long-term buy"" in tech notes 7/12/02
Analyst Ed Snyder lowers his rating from ""buy"" despite a strong quarter from the wireless communications gear maker. Powerwave has a diversified customer base and fewer competitors now, Snyder suggests. But he cuts his estimates and rating based on lower guidance from the company, weak third-generation (3G) wireless network orders, and likely cuts in carrier capital expenditures. The infrastructure market remains lumpy and hard to predict, Snyder says.

AOL on the hunt for new CEO
AOL Time Warner has begun casting a net for a chief executive for its beleaguered America Online division.
The move comes as no surprise. Former AOL CEO Barry Schuler stepped down from the position in April. But it raises questions about the future of Robert Pittman, AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer and the interim head of AOL. Pittman had been charged with fixing the division. As previously reported, sources in the company speculate that Pittman will not return to his duties as COO once he completes his stint at AOL.

However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as 
they are on Windows platform for two main reasons:
1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...) are 
respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters.
2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this

Maybe you could find more info or tips on the ALSA page for your card?
Also, you could try ""alsactl store"", editing /etc/asound.state"" by hand
(for me it contains data similar to what I can control with ""alsamixer"")
then run ""alsactl restore"" and see if you're able to change what you want
that way.

OK, I do this every time I update a kernel.

The 1st time I added ALSA, I tried a non-root rpom build but the DEV things were not
made. Other than that, I bet you could do non-root. The following can be scripted
easily.

1. get (a) alsa-drivers, (b) alas-lib, and (c) alsa-utils tarballs (if upgrading the
kernel then you probably have them from your last install).
2. unpack them somewhere.
3. for each of them, go to the top directory of the unpacked tarball, and do
../configure, then look in (I'm going by memory) TOPDIR/utils/* you should see a spec
file there. Do this for the 3 tarballs and you get 3 spec files.

4. put the source tarballs in SOURCES and the spec files in SPECS, go in order from
a, b, then c, doing
 ""rpmbuild -ba SPECS/alsa-[X].spec; rpm -Uvh RPMS/i386/alsa-[X].rpm""

5. do that in order for the 3 spec files and you have just installed the alsa
drivers on your system. The 1st time you do this you need to put the correct stuff
in your modules.conf file (may take some research) then you get the alsa driver and
OSS compat capabilities, or you can choose not to use the OOS compat stuff.

Script making the spec, then building and upgrading, as above, and you have
""no-sweat"" ALSA.

NOTE: the (null) rpmbuild did take some tweaking, it does a check for files in the
buildroot that you don't specify in your files section. In this case there is an
extra file (going by memory) ""/include/sys/asound.h"". Add a line at the end on the
""install"" section of the spec file to delete that file and you are good to go.

So is this mountain limestone or granite?
If it's limestone, it'll weather pretty fast.

September 05, 2002
A WHALE which suddenly breached and crashed into the bow of a
fishing boat killed a restaurant owner on board.
Jerry Tibbs, 51, of Bakersfield, California, was aboard his boat,
The BBQ, when the whale hit and tossed him into the sea five miles
off Port San Luis.
Three other fishermen stayed aboard the damaged boat, which was
towed to shore by the US Coast Guard.
Tibbs and his three friends were just ending a day fishing for
albacore when the accident occurred, authorities said.
Tibbs' body was found after a search lasting more than 18 hours
Coast Guard officials said it was the first time they could recall
an accident caused by a whale hitting a boat.",0,0

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function

EDITOR'S CORNER
How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet
Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said ""that was great, but you only told half the story"". You wanted to know two more things:
How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users
How to secure the FTP Server
There are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as ""Server Publishing"". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.
Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.
You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:
Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.
Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.
Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.
Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!
k OK
Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.
The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic DNS service"". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.
There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.
Until next week,

HINTS, TIPS, TRICKS & TWEAKS
Allow Dial-up Connections to Synchronize Time with Internet Time Servers
Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:
Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.
Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.
Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.
Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.
That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.
If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.
This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?
HOW TO'S: ALL THE NEW XP FEATURES
How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional
Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:
Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.
Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.
Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.
The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.
Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.
Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in ""clear text"", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.
Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.
Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.
Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.
Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_
account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.
Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.
WINXP SECURITY: UPDATES & PATCHES
Cumulative Patch for Windows Media Player
I think it was a couple months ago when I wrote about some serious problems with the Windows Media Player (WMP). At that time you could download a ""cumulative"" patch that would update the Media Player with the latest security fixes. Well, it's time to download another ""cumulative"" patch! A couple other problems were found in WMP that could cause some problems. To read more about the problem head on over to:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-WMP_Patch
You'll also find the download locations for Windows Media Player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (XP) on that page.
Cumulative Patches for Excel and Word for Windows
If you run Microsoft Word or Excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (XP), then you need to head on over to the Microsoft site to download some security fixes. These fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! Head on over to Microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. You only need download the fix that applies to your computer:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709SE-Word_Excel_Patch
UPGRADING & COMPATIBILITY ISSUES
A Computer May Hang During a Heavy Load with an Ericsson HIS Modem
If your computer has a Ericsson HIS modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL. The problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! Microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. To download a fix visit Microsoft's site. After getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens!
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709UP-HIS_Modem
Knowledge Base Search Center - If it is Not Broke, Do Not Break it!
It wasn't so long ago when you could search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. It was great! But Microsoft decided to ""fix"" the Knowledge Base search page, and now it really sucks! It's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore.
Try this: go to:
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?ln=EN-US≺=kbinfo&
and on the left side of the page select Windows XP in the top drop down list box. Don't put anything in the For solutions containing...(optional) text box. Leave the Any of the words entered option selected in the Using drop down list box. For Maximum Age select 3 days. For Results Limit select 150 articles. Click Search Now. Whoa! Nothing. OK, it's reasonable to see no articles related to Windows XP in the last 3 days. Try again, this time using 7 days. Whaat? Still no articles. OK, it was a holiday week in the USA last week. Let's try 14 days. Nothing again! That seems sort of strange, doesn't it? Let's give it another try with 30 days. Still no articles! What's going on here? Keep trying for 6 months and one year. You still won't find anything. It's pretty sad, because this used to work.
WINXP CONFIGURING & TROUBLESHOOTING
A Description of the Repair Option on a Local Area Network or High-Speed Internet Connection
Here's the answer to a question I've had for a long time. What the heck does that ""Repair"" option for a network connection actually do? It's not in the help file, but it's on the Microsoft Web site. Here's what it does:
Sends an ipconfig /renew
Flushes the ARP cache with a arp -d
Reloads the NetBIOS name cache with a nbtstat -R
Updates its WINS server with an nbtstat -RR
Clear out the DNS client cache with an ipconfig /flushdns
Reregisters the client with a DDNS server with a ipconfig /registerdns
Check out the original article over at:
http://www.winxpnews.com/rd/rd.cfm?id=020709CO-Repair_Option
Keyboard and Mouse Do Not Work When You Start Windows
Have you been hit with this one? You're working in Windows XP and shut down for the day. The next morning you start up your Windows XP computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! The only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. What's up with that? I still haven't figured that one out, but Microsoft has a KB article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. I doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. But if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out:

So I am giving you ONE LAST CHANCE to order the Banned CD! 
With this powerful CD, you will be able to investigate your friends, enemies and lovers in just minutes using the Internet.  You can track down old flames from college, or you can dig up some dirt on your boss to make sure you get that next promotion! 
  
Or maybe you want a fake diploma to hang on your bedroom wall.  You'll find addresses for companies that make these diplomas on the Banned CD. 
Need to disappear fast and never look back?  No problem! 
Using the Banned CD, you will learn how to build a completely 
new identity. 
Obviously, the Powers That Be don't want you to have the Banned CD.  They have threatened me with lawsuits, fines, and even imprisonment unless I stop selling it immediately. But I feel that YOU have a Constitutional right to access this type of information, and I can't be intimidated. 
 Uncle Sam and your creditors are horrified that I am still selling this product!  There must be a price on my head! 
Why are they so upset? Because this CD gives you freedom. 
And you can't buy freedom at your local Walmart.  You will 
have the freedom to avoid creditors, judgments, lawsuits, IRS 
tax collectors, criminal indictments, your greedy ex-wife or 
ex-husband, and MUCH more!

What is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in.
It also depends on what the fad is or what is in style.  (:
I don't have statistics on the love half life, but it seems long-term 
relationships use something else for glue.

Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have
resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,
dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our
demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places
with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).
Actualy our silly antiquated ideas about relationships and love have 
resulted in the bleedings of many upon many a page (and musical  instrumnet, 
and canvas)  What's the problem if we dash a little Mrs. Dash on them?  (:  
Or cayenne.  Or ginger. (mm ask me about ginger root play).  
And let me tell you this: just because a child happens to be 
single-parented (what a word), does not mean that child is dysfunctional 
or lives in a dysfunctional home.  The govt/media/church has tried to make 
it look like there is a disintegration, when in fact, there is a coming 
together of other family members and friends to raise children.  It's not 
decaying -- it's changing.  Nothing wrong with change.
At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.

Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.

Maybe y'all should buy m-w some more bandwidth.

------- Additional Comments From spamassassin-contrib@msquadrat.de  2002-10-03 13:57 -------
I've thought about this and PM_FILTER needs to die. I've now tried  
multiple ways to make it just transparently work on 5.00503 and failed.  
If anyone has any bright ideas please jump in. 
 
You see anyone upgrading from the CPAN shell will get a failure on the line: 
 
   use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45; 
 
Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2."" 
Because it never gets chance to reach a ""WriteMakefile"" line with a  
PREREQ_PM => { ExtUtils::MakeMaker => 5.45 } option. So the CPAN shell  
can't automatically upgrade this module. I cannot think of any way  
around this. 
 
I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway... 
To add insult to injury, the PM_FILTER part gets run during pm_to_blib,  
which would be fine, except ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't let you write a  
MY::pm_to_blib - it's non-overridable! So even though we could  
potentially copy the 5.45 ExtUtils::Install::pm_to_blib code somewhere  
into the spamassassin codebase (I tried that first), we can't cause the  
Makefile to call our code :-( 
 
We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either. 
So I'm *strongly* against the current use of ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45  
usage (if this were an Apache project this would be my veto vote), and  
really hope we can find another way. 
 
The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

  Method of anti-spam
  Abstract
  A method of anti-spam is to set an optional trustcode, or a trustlist, or
  at least a trustweb based on online mail delivery at a recipient's e-mail
  address. A mail sender is compelled at the first time to deliver a mail
by way of: taking the way of ""Visiting trustweb and sending online"", or
enclosing the recipient's trustcode in the mail and sending in another way
other than the mentioned. After the sender's e-mail address has been stored
automatically in the recipient's trustlist, the sender may send mails to
the same recipient in whatever the ways feasible.
Sounds a lot like TMDA to me. :(  Filing date is July 26, 2001,  granted

TMDAers, have you seen this before?  I'd presume TMDA is prior art, but
still, it could be troublesome...

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.
I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).
If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=yes""
in the procmailrc. :)

Bush's reluctance to blast blind obeyance of religion as taught by
your
 
local madrassa or KKK leader, apparently because he is fully involved
with the general effort to expand unfettered religiosity as the
   
solution 
to the world's ills, is disappointing.  He has spoke against madrassa,
but what I heard sounded lame and carefully crafted to shield religion
in general from scrutiny.
   
1. Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters.
A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? 
 Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.
B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 
acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 
people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 
expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 
sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 
the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 
society.
C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 
aren't 'found in the wild'.
(By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 
there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 
behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 
 The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 
40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 
conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)
D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 
less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 
by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 
pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 
integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 
government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 
of British conquest, but who doesn't?)
(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A33761-2001Jul8&notFound=true
http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A15956-2002Jul16&notFound=true
'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and 
cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and 
religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, 
and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part 
of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 
nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.
In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 
violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 
the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 
sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by 
far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united 
Ireland
The provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were 
killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern 
Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""'
2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.
That's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration.  It would be 
difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way.  I'd be 
happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there.
3. US Leadership remains reflexively multi-cultural.
This is ok to a point, as long as it doesn't shy away from logical, 
objective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in 
certain ways.
We all have
disagreements, but at some point it becomes a crime against humanity.
   
I didn't say burning the train was a good thing.  I said I understood it
wasn't a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong.
True, although I don't think you were as clear originally.  :-)

Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
of slaves, who were brought here by force.
More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.
Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
wealth has nothing to do with it.
It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
statistical sophistry.
Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
they're nowhere near the top.
I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.
In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
people living longer.
I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.

Janis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented 
science fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot 
groupmind about her views on the music industry. 
    Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - 
    not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux 
    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy 
    saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is 
    that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. 
    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a 
    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the 
    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to 
    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an 
    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic 
    shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring 
    about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market 
    consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less 
    ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the 
    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because 
    that's all you'll be able to find out there.

*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 
who funded them.*
In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 
information won't be required.
The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 
political spam.
Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.
Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 
groups.
FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 
potential to reach more voters.
""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 
everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said.
Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 
messages while remaining anonymous.
Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.
Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 
""good for America.""
""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 
for office,"" he said. ""We have free speech on our side.""",0,0

His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.
Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).
Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.

""rssflowersalignright""A productive thread[1] on RSS-DEV confronts the 
negativeness about RSS 2.0[2] head-on. This will go someplace interesting.  
I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  
At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.

Here's a brief interview with me.  
    *Interviewer:* If the Boing Boing zine and blog were TV characters, who'd 
    they be, and how'd they get on? 
    *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
    curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory 
    or conspiracy as the absolute truth. The Blog would be Sherman from 
    ""Peabody's Improbable History"" -- a traveler of time and space in search of 
    beauty, truth, and the outre. I think Jethro bOING bOING and Sherman Boing 
    Boing would be great pals. Jethro would invite Sherman's dog, Mr. Peabody, 
    to go raccoon hunting with him, and Sherman would send Jethro 40 years into

By ""meanings have evolved"" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words
have changed meaning or that our understanding of the Hebrew words
have
changed? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had
evolved by time of the Pentateuch?

This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the
Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg
Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.

In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar
claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments:

""""""

We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an
issue.

This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on
our
knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word ""ratsach"". Most modern
translations I've seen translate it ""murder"" but elsewhere the word is
used
of an animal killing a human (something for which most English
speakers
wouldn't use the word ""murder"").

"> Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package
> built against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/
Following that reasoning, I've been installing all my custom-built
kernels through rpm recently. I find it annoying, though, that
alsa-kernel, and similar packages, will only build for the currently
running kernel.
So I've attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
""TARGET_KERNEL"" environment variable before running rpmbuild. You
still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at
least it doesn't have to be currently running. It's kinda hackish, so
if someone has a better way to do this, let me know.
That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what
you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/
	Me and my kernel rpm builds ... this all works along the same idea I have 
been aiming for, but the freaking RedHat Kernel srpms still have been stump 
...
	If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole 
lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms 
are huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...
	I will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working 
idea ...
Thanks guys.
Mailed

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code",0,0

"" CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA.""
-
Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001
THE COMPANY:
CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China.
The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.
Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.
These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.
CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China.
In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.
HIGHLIGHTS:
May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.
February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.
March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.
May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the
leading provider of emerging market securities
.
May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.
June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.
June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition of
Smart Investor Magazine
and related business.
This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.
July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis,
one of the worlds largest aggregators.
INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.

"HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLY
Simple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,
Ron M. Jenkins
Home-Mailing Division Manager

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

And a Java program, due to the extensive class libraries, will weigh

My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
core libraries of any language that much though.
On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
you get right down to it.

First Blood is Spilled at Record Industry Hearings[1]. &#8220;In a shocking 
statement made by Back Street Boy, Kevin Richardson, he testified that they 
have NEVER received a royalty check, and that they only took a large advance 
after their third hit album in a row failed to earn them a penny in 
royalties.&#8221;

You can see Cory Doctorow explain the problems with the Berman Bill while his 
host subscribes to the EFF Action Center on TechTV[1] if you've got Windows 
Media Player. If you're on Windows, you can also hear them. (The Mac version 
doesn't seem to have the codec for the sound.)

Seth[4]: ""I had a dream that I went to D.C. to hear the Eldred argument and 
also dropped by a party to celebrate it. [...] y dream Supreme Court was 
definitely going to reverse the court below, if only because the Solicitor 
General in my dream had hardly found anything good to say about the CTEA. _
Adsit omen! _""

this is true of manatees also.  you don't want to know.
 
So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for 
STATUS - i.e. I can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species, or I can  be ambitious, and 
go after the authority figure in the room.
The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of 
course, there's the ""they'll fuck anything  given
appropriate conditions."" Hmmm, is this a potential intelligence test, 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response?
