三菱化学エンジニアリング様のlivelinkログからは
現在、原因が特定できないため
情報を整理し、環境面を含め、問題の切り分けを行なっていきます。
そのために[Service for UNIX]に関して問題がなかったのか
確認させていただきました。
プロセスダウンの要因として、さまざまなケースがありますが
監査機能ロード不具合、CAの不具合以外に
原因の切り分けのため、プロセスダウンの原因となった内容を
報告していただけないでしょうか。
なお、[Service for UNIX]の問題として、Livelinkの使用する環境とは
直接関係ないかもしれませんがお知らせします。

プロセスダウンが一刻も早く解決できるよう
ご協力お願いいたします。

キヤノン販売（株）
伊藤様
OpenTextの伊東です。お世話になっております。
[Service for UNIX] のご質問として、新しいチケット番号で取り扱わせて
いただきます。サポートのマネージャに確認を取りましたが、現在までに
[Service for UNIX]を使用されているという例は聞いたことがありません。
問題なく動作するかどうかは疑問があるそうです。サポートされていない
環境ですし、実際利用しているというお客様も、0だということです。
（少なくともサポートのほうに報告されている中では、ですが・・・）
何か、[Service for UNIX]が原因では、と考えられることでもあったので
しょうか？もし、三菱化学様で、サポートされている範囲でプロセスダウン
が起こるかテストを行えるようでしたら、確認してみていただけますでしょう
か？できるだけ排除できる要因は切り離していただきたく思います。
（その節は、今までのプロセスダウンのチケット、53121OTC1のほうで
対応いたします。）
よろしくお願い致します。

spam,"Hello,
Premium Phone Qualified
Business Opportunity Leads
If you're spending money marketing a Business
Opportunity
or
MLM
,
you will
definitely
be interested in
what we have to offer you.
You're
tired
of blindly spending money for leads and not having
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.  Sometimes
calling 100 people
without one single signup!
Sometimes
talking to people who have been
bombarded
by bizop pitches
to the point of them
hanging up
when you call!  (Leads oversold)
We're here to help!
We'll get you
qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity.
Period.
No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense.
We'll do it
quickly,
and
professionally
.
And we won't ask you for a
single dime
without
guaranteeing
results
!
Here's How We Generate Our Leads...
-
All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!
- One source we use for Lead-generation is a
Business Opportunity
Seeker Lead List
of people who have requested info. about making
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.  If they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.
- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices
and the following
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
Name:
Email:
Phone:
Best time to call:
State:
Reason they want to work from home!:
How much they want to make per month:
How much time they can commit per week:
How much money they have available for startup:
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you,
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- This way,
you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time*
(only minutes old).  Never more than 24 hours old.  Guaranteed!
- We
GUARANTEE
that you'll receive
AT LEAST
a valid
Name
,
Phone Number
and the
Time-Date Stamp
corresponding to when
the Lead was generated!  However, almost ALL leads will have
ALL of the information asked above.
Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:
1. They will be
Extremely Qualified
due to the nature of the
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. They are
Super-Fresh!
Delivered in Real-Time only
moments
after they are contacted and qualified!  (Not 30-120 days old)
3. They're
Targeted.
Each Lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. They're
Highly Receptive!
Receptivity is very, very high
because they
aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching
them on opportunities!
Also they'll remember speaking to
someone over the phone.  Especially since
we tell them to
expect your call!
5.
No ""feast or famine""
activity.  Leads will be coming in
regularly.  You dictate the flow!
6.
No more cold calls!
We tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. You can
*personalize* your approach
with the info. you
get with each Lead!
8.
Save Time.
Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.
9.
Lower ""burnout"" factor.
Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. You can
sort your Leads
based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. You can
get new reps started quicker
using these Leads due
to
higher closing ratios
.  Of course, this builds faster and stronger
momentum, and skyrockets ""new rep retention"" as a result of
""quick successes"".
12. The
Leads will be uniform
- almost all leads will have the info.
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. They're
double-qualified
because to generate the Lead,
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. Excellent
control of the flow of Leads
coming through.
If you've been trying to run things too long without a
steady flow
of high
quality leads, call us
NOW
to get things in motion.  Just let us know
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized
lead-generation campaign for you.
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been
more critical than it is today, why not call us
NOW!
These are
fresh, highly qualified leads
because these people aren't
just responding to some ""Generic Business Opportunity"" ad, they're
contacted
over the phone specifically
for
YOUR
company!  And we
forward you the leads within
minutes
of the lead being generated - not
days, weeks, or months!
Start Generating As Many
SIGN-UPS
as You Can Handle!

It doesn't need to as Red Hat Linux already sets correct permissions on all
ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms
file) and the modules.conf files takes care of loading the right modules on
demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work
for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the
computer is halted, even using ALSA.
Ah!  The mixer stuff was what made me look for an init script in the
first place, I didn't bother to check whether the existing stuff would
have worked with that.  Will try that out, you can assume silence =success :)
>From what I can tell after only 2 days using it : ALSA rocks, especially
since having a full OSS compatibility results that it breaks nothing at
all! :-)
Agreed.  Though with only 2 hours experience...

ham,"This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
me!
Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.
From the spamc man page:
       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.
The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:
       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.
I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

|
| Hi All,
|
| I am running SpamAssassin 2.41 with procmail as my local delivery agent
| with sendmail.  I use spamc/spamd so that it runs site-wide from
| /etc/procmailrc.
|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with
| any flags.
|
| When I was testing the program, I deployed spamc from my personal
| ~/.procmailrc file, my ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file was read each time.
| I can see this because I have a non-default ""required_hits"" value which
| gets reported in every e-mail on the ""X-Spam-Status"" line.
|
| Now that I run spamc from the global /etc/procmailrc file, my
| ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from
| e-mails from outside computers.  The ""required_hits"" value gets set back
| to the one in /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf.  However, if I send local
| e-mail, my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly.
|
| Does anyone know how to fix this problem?  if this is a spamassassin or
| procmail bug?
|
| Thanks,
|
| Cheryl

behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. 
     (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the ex

window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I sel
     ect 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs 
     and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then w
     hat 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be m
     ore 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:

Application       What gets pasted

XEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in 
     exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten

The last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what get
     s 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highligh
     ted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).

It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him
Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian
Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

Article about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter 
belonging to the Irish Travelers. The reason she beat up her little girl, he 
thinks, is becasue she was pissed that the kid blew her con at a toy store. 
    Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. ""The little 
    girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not 
    getting refunds she took it out on the little girl."" 
I don't know anything about the Irish Travelers, but I'm wondering if they are 
getting a bad rap about being con-artists. This Irish Traveler FAQ[1] says 
""some Travellers are con men, but, just like other Americans, most are not.""

There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
was one. Google News[1] is another. 
In its first day, I've already noticed: 
- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
- Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

<b>QUESTIONS: </b><p>
From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com <br>
Subject: Using pictures as links <p>
I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>
How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

Subject: Access using a proxy <p>
From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>
--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>
<p>
A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>
I have a detailed right-up on them at <a href=""http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php""> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>
See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>
CJ, <p>
Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
http://www.anonymise.com and
http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>
However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

Dennis <br>

~~~~<p>
I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.<p>
I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>
As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
~~~~<p>
Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.<br>
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.<br>
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
~~~~<p>
I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
~~~~<p>
This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>
~~~~<p>
Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""<br>
~~~~<p>
A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
~~~~<p>
What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
~~~~<p>
A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting

<b>QUESTIONS: </b><p>
From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com <br>
Subject: Using pictures as links <p>
I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  <p>
How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. <p>

<b>ANSWERS:</b><p>
From: Zaak  - Zaako@linkpaks.com <br>
Subject: Access using a proxy <p>
From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>
--> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- <br>
<p>
A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! <p>
I have a detailed right-up on them at <a href=""http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php""> http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php </a>
See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.

Subject: Using A Proxy To Visit Blocked Sites <p>
From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) <br>
Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) <p>
CJ, <p>
Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: <br>
http://www.anonymise.com and
http://www.anonymizer.com . <p>
However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or 
may not visit, then it is time to change providers! <p>

Dennis <br>
damorganjr@yahoo.com<br>
~~~~<p>
I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.<p>
I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  <p>
As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. <br>
~~~~<p>
Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.<br>
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.<br>
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.<br>
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.<br>
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.<br>
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.<br>
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.<br>
~~~~<p>
I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!<br>
~~~~<p>
This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*<br>
~~~~<p>
Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""<br>
~~~~<p>
A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.<br>
~~~~<p>
What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. <br>
~~~~<p>
A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads. <p>

Oh well, I guess there are other anti-spam options out there.
Well, (a) you don't HAVE to upgrade, and (b) what you are doing has never
been safe in the first place because SpamAssassin 2.31-and-before doesn't
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesn't
promise to return the proper failure code on disk-full conditions, etc.
If you're still willing to live with (b), all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin:
----------
#!/bin/sh
# call this file ""spamassassin-wrapper"" and chmod +x it
{
echo ""From $1 `date`""
sed -e '1{/^From /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $MAIL
----------
And then use
fetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %F'
and you should be all set.

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like

give that a go and it should work np.

rpm -i [rpm package]

this installs it and then i try to uninstall it again and it still

How can i get it to recognize that the package is indeed installed it,

ham,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617
Date: Not supplied
A lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.
Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.
- The link toolbar is: 
- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?
-  link what?
- The sidebar is 
- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate
- Form auto-fill 
- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically
- Downloads 
- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.
- Toolbars should 
- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason
- Composer should 
- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.
- Mail should 
- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.
Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. 
Why? 
A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.
Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.

Are you using the same version of GCC to compile the plugin as its C++

Yes, I am.  Everything is built inside a chroot.  I think it isn't linking

In my experience, there are spam messages that sneak past Spam Assassin,
that Razor will pick up. Those are the ones that I'm calling ""marginal"".
Basically, I'm hoping that ""the collective"" of Razor users make a better
judge of spam than any single program like SA can, and therefore I can
benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering. I've
seen examples of this already, where SA doesn't score the spam high enough
to bounce it, but Razor does.
I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  If
you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this
in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.
  score RAZOR_CHECK 10
The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.
Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA
then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5
would be sufficient.
If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.
Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once
for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor
individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA
won't do it and avoid the double network hit.
However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has
been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The
current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.
But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.
Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
of use as Razor1.

  had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know
that we
  will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have
gotten a
  tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
  the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.
Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
  Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
  sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier

with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
G-Force Dyno-Staff.
I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.
To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.
I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

One effect of getting rid of MINCOUNT is that it latches on more
strongly to rare clues now, and those can be unique to the corpus
trained on (e.g., one trained ham says ""gryndlplyx!"", and a followup
new ham quotes it).
This may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure:  in real life, msgs
come ordered in time.  Say there's a thread that spans N messages on c.l.py.
In our testing setup, we'll train on a random sampling throughout its whole
lifetime, and test likewise.  New ham ""in the middle"" of this thread gets
benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and *after*
it in real life.  It's quite plausible that the f-p rate would rise without
this effect; in real life, at any given time some number of ham threads will

ham,"LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work 
every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just 
decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and 
consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of 
variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:
Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive. 
Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very 
well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, 
it is creative sensuality.  (:

""Chastity"" technologies were doomed from the start, and I'll add chemical 
ones to the trash heap.  (Yeah, Cindy, these are decorative toys for the 
subculture, but....)  

Generally,someone is attempting to preserve a relationship with this 
nonsense, when quite plainly the the relationship is in a state where 
preserving it is of little value.  Hardware is of no real use save for 
playing the power-struggle game.   I don't want to see the future of this.
""Invisible Fence"" for your mate.   ""Must wear"" location transponders and 
endocrine monitors.   More movies like ""Minority Report.""

It seems so automatic for people to reach for coercive solutions.   So 
surprizing given the low absolute effectiveness of coercion in the absense 
of overwhelming force advantage.

""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.
""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.
I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.
The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:
Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.
Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.
The statute of limitations:
507. Limitations on actions
(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.
(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.
The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.
I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

Hi!

Is there a command to insert the signature using a combination of keys and not

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.
There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).
And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...

DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.
Good morning,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.
Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.
The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.
Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.
I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive
US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.
Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.
May God's blessings be with you even as you reply.

One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate 
was an economist claim ""a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for 
something they can get for free."" Someone objected, using the analogy of 
bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  
Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! 
More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian 
and others. 
Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd

DEAR Sir,
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this  is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of theday. we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction,let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am the manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos NIgeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$20 million(twenty million US Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development,we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim. To this effect,I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of kin to the deceased and claim this money.We need a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every documentto be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines,
So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money
will be for you, 10%for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be
donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues
and I.  If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter
and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.
Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of Application for
immediate Application of Claim.
Thanks for your anticipated assistance.

  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.
That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.
In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.
I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.
  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.
OK.
  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.
In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)
  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
  | 
  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.
Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using
*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2
The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.

resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,
dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our
demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places
with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).
At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.
There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue
with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the
population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for
being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,
etc.
Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.
Some actual data for the US are here:

ham,"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 
http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html
<<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women 
is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an 
individual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we 
find an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than 
the mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just 
one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>
As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.

business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in

unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.

==========
Who's the real monster?
It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.
Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.
Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.
The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?
Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.
 9/18/02; 10:07:38 AM - Discuss
Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand
It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.
What Dave does is just the opposite.
Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.
One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""
Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.
We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.
If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...
The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.
Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:
His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.
In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""
The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar
tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?
It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.
I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.
Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!
The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!
Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!
Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?
Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Wow, apparently Dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig
Schamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:

RSS 2.0: code name ""Hitler""
If Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community
consensus, here now we call it the ""Hitler"" release of 2.0.
""No objections""?  No, he means ""No objections I choose to hear.""
Dave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""
Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.
So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:
http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336
This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.
Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!
Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:
Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

When's a Permalink not a Permalink?
When Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to
nothing at that point. So apparently the ""perma-"" part in permalink is
permanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a
definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!

Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.
Agreed.
But I have always thought that the value 5 was not the best value.  It
should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores
were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely
symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been
balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.
Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative
would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's
choice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume
things work differently than they do.

Working at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:
    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,
    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and
* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.
To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.
""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread

Gappy text in a non-spam?  It must be a  H E A D L I N E  or something.  
Maybe just remove space from the list of ""gap"" characters?
For 2.50, we could try to figure out which nonspams are hitting and
improve the rule.


BTW I subscribe to the Media Unspun newsletter, and it and a few others
regularly use that H E A D L I N E thing.

splitting it into 2, one that matches gappy text with punctuation chars,
one that matches spaces between the chars, would probably help.  if
anyone's bothered, I'd suggest filing a bug.

As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc

probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)
I think this is probably the best way, because I think (maybe) with upgrading you
do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file
because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file (you get a
rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file) so they get less calls to support that way.
Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my
laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is
dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data?
Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box
with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a
space computer with a large HD with much free space).
These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that

This year's
SIC
gets the blame for the 
lateness of this issue. Lori and I spent Wednesday thru Sunday meeting 
software authors, participating in educational sessions, viewing product 
demonstrations, and most of all having fun. This was Lori's second trip 
to an SIC conference, so she got to reacquaint herself with many familiar 
faces, while I was getting to put faces with many people I've exchanged 
e-mails with over the last several years. As much as I enjoy information 
exchange via computer, the human interaction of meeting people and 
sharing ideas and stories face-to-face is priceless.
One cool discovery at this year's SIC, pertaining directly to Webmasters, 
is Nick Bradbury's release of
TopStyle 3.0
. 
Nick's the guy who created HomeSite, long before it joined the Macromedia 
family of products. Version 3 represents a return to those HTML editing 
roots, with the addition of editing capabilities now functioning 
hand-in-hand with the rock solid style sheet building features that 
previously defined  TopStyle. Conversion of existing font tags to CSS is 
just one of several new additions. I should have a full review in one of 
the next two issues.
Also in the coming soon category - a GnomeTome on Cold Fusion, written by 
one of Iowa's resident ColdFusion experts (who also happens to be an 
expert on an International level), Kevin Schmidt. Kevin wrote the
Training From the Source
book on Cold Fusion 5 and is currently writing a revision for 
ColdFusionMX. The GnomeTome means we'll have a nice pairing of tips for 
both static pages, in the form of
Dreamweaver tips
, and tips on dynamic 
site development with Kevin's tips on ColdFusion.

screen of configurations. A source view makes manual editing of the 
file easier, by bolding and coloring various configuration directives, 
similar to the way HTML editors mark code. Avoid typos with built-in

Supporting standards and writing good code are often things that the number

importance of standards and good code can be an uphill battle; after all, 
you're just a programmer, right? MACCAWS aims to make your job easier, via 
an open discussion on the establishment of standards that will make sense 
to the folks who control the bottom line. Their mission is to educate 
business leaders by providing you the end user with tools that will help 
make a case for applying standards to your Web efforts. If you've got a

It seems to only support PPPoA and not PPPoE. You need one that supports
PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.
The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.
Hope this is useful,

RedHat has a preferences -> themes app, but themes only show up there that have BOTH
gtk1.2 (Gnome1) themes AND gtk1.4 (GTK2 aka Gnome2) themes available. Then RH will
apply the theme to both GTK versions, so the user does not really notice that
different GTK toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.
This ""gtk2-engines-compat"" RPM has GTK2 ported themes for those themes that are

As if there weren't enough hypocrisy and misinformation 
being spewed by marketing and sales departments. This time, 
a
startling revelation
that Microsoft refuses 
to use their own ISA Server to protect themselves from the 
very things the product is meant to stop - worms and 
intrusion. Nimda was turned loose within Microsoft and 
they've chosen NetScreen's 500 series security appliance to 
cure what ills them. I find this staggeringly hilarious, to 
say the least. The move is tantamount to Intel deploying 
desktops based on AMD processors!
Ok, so a hardware solution might be better than a 
software defense in many cases. I suppose we can't entirely 
blame Microsoft for opting to go that route. Probably a wise 
decision, in fact - admit defeat and move on. However, why 
is Nimda spreading within the corporate walls to the point 
that they felt the needed to make such a leap in the first 
place? After all, patches were released months ago, so IIS 
is impervious to attack now. Still considering the 
deployment of IIS as your web server platform of choice? 
Things that make you go hmmmm...

SQL Server Install Leaves Passwords Behind
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-035.asp
During the installation of SQL Server 7.0 or 2000, 
various bits of configuration information are stored in a 
setup.iss file, including account passwords that have been 
captured in order to configure the services. Prior to 
certain service packs, these passwords are stored as clear 
text, which is problematic because the file is left on the 
hard drive after the installation process is completed. 
Peruse the details of the bulletin to be sure you've cleaned 
up any relevant bits and pieces applicable to your 
environment.
SQL Server Cumulative Patch
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS02-034.asp
A new roll-up patch is available for SQL Server that takes 
care of all previous security issues, plus a trio of new 
items. Two buffer overrun vulnerabilities exist that could 
allow an attacker to gain control over the server, and a 
different privilege elevation flaw can be exploited due to 
improper permissions within the registry. All three are 
spackled over by the latest cumulative patch described 
further in this bulletin.

Win2K Memory Allocation Adjustments
Unearthed by Wayne Clark
http://searchwin2000.techtarget.com/tip/0,289483,sid1_gci835208,00.html
Most Windows 2000 servers tune themselves fairly well and 
do not need further tweaking. In those cases, it's best to 
just leave things alone unless you specifically identify a 
problem somewhere. Serdar Yegulalp has an excellent 
explanation of one particular situation where memory pools 
can be exhausted and crash the server. Before you go diving 
into the registry to play with the knobs and buttons, be 
certain you know what you're messing with or you could just 
make things worse. Backups, backups, backups.

Broadband Sharing Crackdown
http://news.com.com/2100-1033-942323.html
Those of us with wireless networking equipment might be 
tempted to allow the neighbors to share the wealth, but be 
careful. Broadband companies are catching on and putting a 
stop to the practice. What's concerning to me is that I 
don't share my wireless network, but I do use quite a few 
different machines at any given time. If someone is snooping 
around and seeing a lot of different sessions and gets 
curious, might I be subject to a teeth-kicking?
Virtual Sketching
Discovered by Diana
http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2mfh8/
I believe I still have an old Etch-A-Sketch in a box 
somewhere. Maybe I should dig it back out and webify the 
thing just for grins. Check out this example of novelty web 
programming, assuming y'all don't kill the site. If it's 
down, check back later. Using a web form, you can enter the 
moves you'd like to see represented on the pad, which is 
viewed through a live webcam. I'd love to see someone craft 
the Lockergnome logo. Impress me...
Recommend It!

All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable

and majordomo, which seems to have stagnated. Oh, and there's apparently
something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.

Cable companies cracking down on Wi-Fi
Broadband providers are cracking down on popular Wi-Fi networks, threatening to cut service to customers who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.
Time Warner Cable of New York City has given 10 customers less than a week to stop using their accounts to provide a wireless local area network available to anyone within 300 feet. The letters are just an initial volley; Time Warner expects to send additional letters, while AT&T Broadband also is preparing similar letters for some of its customers.

Apple's iPod comes to Linux
Windows users have recently been given access to the popular Macintosh music player, iPod, and now Linux users may soon be able to take a bite out of Apple Computer's gadget. Last week, tex9, a small software-development company in San Francisco, began beta testing an iPod plug-in for its xtunes music player software, which is itself a Linux clone of Apple's iTunes. The plug-in will, tex9 promises, allow drag-and-drop access to iPod, which holds up to 10GB of music.

Microsoft eyes Visa users with Passport
Microsoft hopes to extend its Passport online identification system into authorizing credit card payments.
The software giant will strike a partnership Tuesday with security-software maker Arcot Systems, which builds online payment systems for merchants and for banks that issue Visa and MasterCard credit cards.

Judge OKs suit against Kazaa parent
A federal judge said Monday that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popular Kazaa software.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) sued three prominent file-swapping companies in October in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Networks, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally created the Kazaa software.

I thought we were quite good about it, in the README file!
procmail is essential *if* you're using (a) SpamAssassin for local
delivery, (b) not using a milter, and (c) not using a Mail::Audit
script instead.  So probably yes.

Yes, the public key of the signature you want to check :-).

Are you really sure that you have the public key of the message's
signature? If not, try downloading it or try to check a signature from
which you know you have the public key.



Ah, sorry for not making that clearer.
But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.
Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about
life on Earth today.
The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy
that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in
an imperfect world.

I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa,
our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in
practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and
taking share from every other government broadcaster.
It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.
Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re:
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared
they might.
As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on
how engaged we are in the world around us.
Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research
stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all
the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.
Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the
real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes.
I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit
such a principle to be loosed upon the world.

Full Text: Bush's National Security Strategy
Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security
strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the
United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of
the Administration's policy.
INTRODUCTION
THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People
everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them;
worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own
property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.
Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.
Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies
against us.
To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal --
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every
turn.
The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny,
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.
As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,
trade, and cultural advancement.
Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and
drug cartels within their borders.
The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly,
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of
AIDS and other infectious diseases.
In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is
guided by the conviction that all nations have important
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.
We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.
Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has
been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in
this great mission.
I. Overview of America's International Strategy
""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and
open societies on every continent.""
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002
The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that
favors freedom.
For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and
equality.
That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.
This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations
with other states, and respect for human dignity.
And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.
To achieve these goals, the United States will:
* champion aspirations for human dignity;
* strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent
attacks against us and our friends;
* work with others to defuse regional conflicts;
* prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our
friends, with weapons of mass destruction;
* ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and
free trade;
* expand the circle of development by opening societies and building
the infrastructure of democracy;
* develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of
global power; and
* transform America's national security institutions to meet the
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.
II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity
""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require
different methods, but not different moralities.""
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002
In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of
the secret police.
America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human
dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state;
free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women;
religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.
These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures,
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and
aspirations of their people.
Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.
Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all
cherish.
Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,
the national security strategy of the United States must start from
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.
Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international
bodies.
We will:
* speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to
advance freedom;
* use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;
* make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights
to move toward a better future; and
* take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.
We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist
it.
III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends
""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of
our choosing.""
President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001
The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated,
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.
In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.
The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some
unseen.
Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.
Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command,
control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.
We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial
tools necessary to finish the task.
The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative
financial networks.
However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we
seek.
We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:
* direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) or their precursors;
* defending the United States, the American people, and our interests
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing
harm against our people and our country; and
* denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign
responsibilities.
We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international
terrorism. This includes:
* using the full influence of the United States, and working closely
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government
can condone or support and all must oppose;
* supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;
* diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources
on areas most at risk; and
* using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.
While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter
attack.
This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public
and the private sector.
This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example,
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.
While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and
our allies can provide.
As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists
In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.
IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts
""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements
look so small.""
President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002
Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to
alleviate suffering and restore stability.
No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action --
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic,
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:
* The United States should invest time and resources into building
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local
crises when they emerge.
* The United States should be realistic about its ability to help
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.
Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will
apply these principles:
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.
The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support
for the creation of a Palestinian state.
Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state.
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides,
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.
In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan
that can help defuse military confrontation.
Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.
In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of
the entire hemisphere.
Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs
in our own country.
In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic
security to the Colombian people.
In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority --
combating global terror. American interests and American principles,
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence
infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.
An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars
spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions
of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to
confronting these emerging transnational threats.
Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that
focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This
administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the
region:
* countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement
and require focused attention;
* coordination with European allies and international institutions is
essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace
operations; and
* Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations
must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational
threats on a sustained basis.
Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the
surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are
conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically
waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to
the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a
common responsibility for democratic political systems offers
opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.
V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends
with Weapons of Mass Destruction
""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and
technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear
weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs,
even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to
strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and
have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the
capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and
we will oppose them with all our power.""
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002
The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our
allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of
force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security
environment has undergone profound transformation.
Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our
relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the
balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear
arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as
counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were
inconceivable.
But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.
None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and
motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain
destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest
states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass
destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex
and dangerous.
In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue
states that, while different in important ways, share a number of
attributes. These states:
* brutalize their own people and squander their national resources
for the personal gain of the rulers;
* display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,
and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;
* are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with
other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively
to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;
* sponsor terrorism around the globe; and
* reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything
for which it stands.
At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's
designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against
Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear
weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become
the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested
increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal.
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as
well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has
become a looming threat to all nations.
We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients
before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction
against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must
take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military
forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective
missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence
collection and analysis.
Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:
* Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend
against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key
capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce
capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our
homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated
into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of
our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed
adversaries.
* Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and
terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise
necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy,
arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction
assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when
necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will
continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their
increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and
threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20
billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step
forward.
* Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD
use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of
WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such
weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading
enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States
must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our
forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.
It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of
this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the
United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have
in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy
of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be
caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.
We cannot let our enemies strike first.
* In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we
faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an
effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of
retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states
more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and
the wealth of their nations.
* In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons
of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and
military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also
allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our
allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior
of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means
of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.
* Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the
targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death
and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between
states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to
action.
For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer
an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves
against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars
and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption
on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible
mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.
We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and
objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not
seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would
fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use
of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed
and delivered covertly and without warning.
The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian
population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law
of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001,
mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and
these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired
and used weapons of mass destruction.
The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions
to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the
threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling
the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To
forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United
States will, if necessary, act preemptively.
The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging
threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.
Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek
the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot
remain idle while dangers gather.
We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our
actions. To support preemptive options, we will:
* build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide
timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;
* coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the
most dangerous threats; and
* continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to
conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.
The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat
to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our
actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.
VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and
Free Trade.
""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a
privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever
enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in
better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade
revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""
President Bush
Monterrey, Mexico
March 22, 2002
A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing
prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth
supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher
incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs
economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it
reinforces the habits of liberty.
We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's
shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic
policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our
economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of
policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic
growth, including:
* pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business
investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;
* tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that
improve incentives for work and investment;
* rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are
confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic
endeavors;
* strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most
efficient use;
* sound fiscal policies to support business activity;
* investments in health and education that improve the well-being and
skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and
* free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the
diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and
opportunity.
The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not
command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the
best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further
strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for
all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the
developing world.
A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S.
national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies
for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake
of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in
their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are
Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of
non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to
use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners --
including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they
are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher
global economic growth.
Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic
growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand
the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging
markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise
living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a
world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that
allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in
their future.
We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve
access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will
continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial
markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action
Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and
more effectively resolving them when they occur.
The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from
occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy
conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on
achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,
exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.
The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it
became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something
that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the
freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free
trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:
* Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we
helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,
especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for
completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the
accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade
Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.
* Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies
in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of
the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United
States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners,
targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and
government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the
poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences
allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free
trade.
* Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the
free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration
will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and
Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of
developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.
Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will
be our principal focal points.
* Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every
administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished
majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing
Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for
developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will
work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade
agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade
Promotion Authority.
* Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade
policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,
competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open
societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional
integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in
developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa
Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods
produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more
use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue
to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer
countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access,
the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public
health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are
flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical
medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and
malaria.
* Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.
Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing
disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a
global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations
that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws
against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international
community must be able to address genuine concerns about government
subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which
undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.
* Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound
statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used
in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the
American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the
enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that
the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American
workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the
change and dynamism of open markets.
* Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster
economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with
widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental
concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network""
between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the
International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade
talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.
* Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security
and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our
allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and
types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere,
Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to
work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient
technologies.
Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize
greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing
them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the
global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse
gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such
emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10
years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be
to:
* remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for
international cooperation;
* obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of
the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to
companies that can show real cuts;
* develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission
reductions;
* promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as
well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,
while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;
* increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to
a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change
by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's
budget; and
* assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas
emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and
resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and
better path.
VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building
the Infrastructure of Democracy
""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""
President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
Development Bank)
March 14, 2002
A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human
race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including
all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and
opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of
U.S. international policy.
Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic
growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served
to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and
perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction
achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.
Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this
failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and
the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.
This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential
of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is
impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have
implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels
of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should
set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's
poorest economies within a decade.
The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to
achieve this goal:
* Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of
national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core
development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our
present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,
these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge
Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest
in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight
corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest
in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and
enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward
countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those
that have not to implement reforms.
* Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development
banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a
comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other
multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of
the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.
contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S.
contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the
World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African
Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing
poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially
in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral
development banks to focus on activities that increase economic
productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,
and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant
must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in
developing countries.
* Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development
assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's
poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that
more children are getting a better education, more people have access to
health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a
better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure
the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering
results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own
development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral
development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA
replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation
system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time,
donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the
achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S.
contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the
World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this
progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything
that these institutions do.
* Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in
the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants
is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,
particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA
agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the
poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water,
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress
by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development
banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private
sector to match government efforts by using grants to support
development projects that show results.
* Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are
the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,
most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and
foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows
as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national
security strategy.
* Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor
countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics
like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be
threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the
developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest
governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective
local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new
global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for
treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than
twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the
global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.
* Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of
democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources
are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States
will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20
percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher
training in Africa. The United States can also bring information
technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been
devastated by AIDS.
* Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies,
including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields
in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.
Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits
to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.
VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers
of Global Power
""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th
century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead
of prepare for war.""
President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002
America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as
broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance
of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires
clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent
consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.
There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can
accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies
and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the
strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its
inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European
security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world
trade.
The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself
recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the
first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the
transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop
new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new
circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice,
highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to
respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.
The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,
creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:
* expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and
able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;
* ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate
combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;
* develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become
effective multinational fighting forces;
* take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of
scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that
they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;
* streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to
meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of
training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations;
and
* maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as
we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.
If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a
partnership as central to the security and interests of its member
states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common
perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to
take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the
same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater
foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to
close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We
cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of
transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.
The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances.
Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an
attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the
dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation
Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented
levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our
alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received
invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.
The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia
not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and
friendships, we will:
* look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and
global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our
close defense and diplomatic cooperation;
* work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while
preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of
the region over the longer-term;
* build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we
continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as
we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;
* maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our
allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic
environment; and
* build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with
institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage
change in this dynamic region.
We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power
competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of
internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all
three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly
global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.
With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based
on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on
Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a
critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,
long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United
States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their
country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external --
needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that
Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that
Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.
United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to
refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and
challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the
global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the
World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to
promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have
created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security
cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will
continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the
former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable
neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration
into the Euro-Atlantic community.
At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still
divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to
build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our
motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our
relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market
democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very
weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those
opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even
decades.
The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral
relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests
require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest
democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative
government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest
in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.
Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear
and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But
while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about
India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with
which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership
with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic
future.
The United States relationship with China is an important part of our
strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous
China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future.
Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst
features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the
next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.
In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its
neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national
greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is
the only source of that greatness.
The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing
China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including
the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean
peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and
similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats,
such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the
welfare of our citizens.
Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become
more open with information, promote the development of civil society,
and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to
political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting
village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national
one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly
accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work
remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think,
assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.
Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into
the World Trade Organization, which will create more export
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers,
and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and
the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance
openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic
protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other
areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the
self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human
rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation
commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but
not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.
The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for
relations between the United States and other main centers of global
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies
in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we
must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships
become routine and unproductive.
Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We
can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober
analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices
that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open
the path of progress.
IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the
Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century
""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch
its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity,
and enterprise of our people.""
President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
September 20, 2001
The major institutions of American national security were designed in a
different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be
transformed.
It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength.
We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's
highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively,
our military must:
* assure our allies and friends;
* dissuade future military competition;
* deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and
* decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.
The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their
forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must
confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to
deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on
how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might
occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational
challenges.
The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound
symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of
power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the
many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as
well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment
of U.S. forces.
Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major
planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate
across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch
of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by
developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision
strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the
ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure
U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S.
infrastructure and assets in outer space.
Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new
approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S.
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and
technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is
run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.
Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight
the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a
wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of
coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.
We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from
experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must
and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy --
whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United
States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces
sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces
will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the
United States.
Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense
against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed
around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,
fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping
with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of
targets.
We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to
keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be
appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems
and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the
capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek
the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and
to maximize injury.
We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide
integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since
the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted
inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of
information between intelligence and law enforcement.
Initiatives in this area will include:
* strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence
to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence
capabilities;
* establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides
seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing
the nation and our allies;
* continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to
sustain our intelligence advantage;
* investing in future capabilities while working to protect them
through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence
capabilities; and
* collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the
government with all-source analysis.
As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend
America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other
nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding
sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State
Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with
other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must
be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations
and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in
international politics must also extend their reach to understand
complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public
health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.
Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil
wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief
requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build
police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial
government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international
cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American
readiness to play our part.
Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out
to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to
public information efforts that can help people around the world learn
about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,
a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas
and this is an area where America must excel.
We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet
our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired
by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the
International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend
to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with
other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and
cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral
agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will
implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose
provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S.
personnel and officials.
We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the
right level and allocation of government spending on national security.
The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this
war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for
the American people.
Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is
diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have
a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas,
and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish --
our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are
vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we
bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks.
As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that
until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This
is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite
of it.
In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and
interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act
apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we
disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for
our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow
such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with
our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.
Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the
skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of
our institutions. A diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,
entrepreneurial energy. Our strength comes from what we do with that
energy. That is where our national security begins.",8,ham
ham,"Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow 
Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Senders should vary the recipient list to include non-targets, like party 
officials, and to exclude targets enough to give them plausible 
deniability.
Which means the sender has a list of who the true
targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
my email client distinguishes between messages
that are read, and messages that are not. I like
to mark or save messages that are particularly
interresting or important to me. And even if I
make a point to delete ""suspicious material""
immediately upon reading it, even THAT might
leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.
Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam
protects people who want to distribute or see
material the government disapproves.

but if you didn't just *remove* the headers and instead reverted
back to the X-Spam-Prev versions, it'd more-or-less work.

(BTW fixed the downloads page ;)
&check now un-defangs MIME -- it was screwing up some of my mass-check
results (where SA-markup was present, yes).
If there ever was a warning about SA-markup in mass-check, it never
worked for me.

Since they can't send up aircraft to update images in realtime every
time, how is this different from just releasing the map on DVDs?  Why
wireless?
It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.
Got it?

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
drives become cheaper.
So, just write-protect the hard disk for partitions that are static.

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.
If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.
Egh.  I really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent.   I
blame law school and my cat.

Q. I'M TIRED OF GETTING SO MANY CREDIT CARD OFFERS IN THE MAIL. 
I ALREADY HAVE 
A CARD AND I DON'T WANT ANY MORE MAIL OFFERING ME NEW ONES. HOW 
CAN I STOP IT? 
A. There are three main credit bureaus in the United States, and 
they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to 
be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and 
telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request.

YOUR MONEY 
RESOLUTIONS YOU CAN KEEP
Let's face it, New Year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that 
hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows Eeyore 
everywhere he goes. We mostly fail to keep our resolutions 
because they are too vague and imply guilt-inducing judgment. 1. 
Live every moment. 2. Be a good person. 3. Lose a lot of weight. 
No pressure. Right? Wrong. 
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=562070
Don't despair. We've put together a quick, proactive to-do list 
that is actually doable. This year's resolution: Save big bucks 
now and live comfortably in the future. Now that's a resolution 
you can get behind. Let's get started! 
1. DIAL AWAY YOUR DEBT 
It's true. You can lower your credit card interest rates with 
one phone call.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562071 
2. GET MORE FROM YOUR SAVINGS
Don't stash your short-term cash savings under your mattress. 
Earn higher yields on CDs, money markets, and more. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562072
3. INVEST FOR LESS 
Make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. Compare rates 
and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562073
4. RETIRE EARLY
Thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more 
to your retirement accounts.
http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=562074
5. REFINANCE AND SAVE 
When interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity 
to save big money.

If this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SPOTLIGHT
SHOULD ALL MY SAVINGS BE IN THE MARKET?
Um, no. 
We are big supporters of the idea that all of your long-term 
money should be in the stock market. But over the short term, 
the market is too volatile. Buying stocks for short-term gain is 
really speculating, not investing. Would you have wanted to have 
your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's 
tuition in the Nasdaq at its height on March 10, 2000? If you 
can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your 
savings, keep it out of the market.
Of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. To figure 
out the best place to keep your short-term savings, visit our 
nifty Savings Center.

COMMUNITY TIPS
DO (AT LEAST) ONE THING DIFFERENTLY
Folks on the Living Below Your Means discussion board have been 
sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 
2002 to save money. 
-I am going to make sure I carry my coupon envelope in my purse 
 so I don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of 
 stuff on which I could save a bunch of money if I hadn't left my 
 coupons at home. 
-Make sure I get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. I 
 have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, 
 like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. Ten miles is 
 $3.10 and if I do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 
 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. 
-I'm going to make at least one crock-pot meal a week so I don't 
 get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. Fridays would be 
 a great time to do this. 
-Either cut down on the long-distance phone calls, or else find 
 a cheaper long-distance plan.
-Document everything that I give to charity, including the 
 clothes and books, so that I can deduct it from my taxes. 
-Keep turning down the thermostat at night and when I leave the 
 house. Run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). 
Have any tips of your own? Add to the growing list here.

I love this business.  If a bridge falls over, the architect or the
engineer is in court the next day, but when a /software/ bridge falls
over, we blame the air beneath it, or the phase of the moon, or
(more often) the people walking on it.

   /balls/ of your feet, not lead with your heels?  Didn't they read
   the blueprints?  They were posted in the town hall.  Any idiot
   would know the 0.75Hz heel cadence would pop rivets on the
   structural supports!  Geez. Pedestrians are /so/ stupid.""
Ours is the /only/ industry that can hold itself 100% un-responsible
for any and all sloth-inflicted doom, and the only industry which can
/also/ get away with feeding this myth of infallibility unquestioned
to the media, to investors, to students and to each other.
   ""God I hate telephones.  Telephones are stupid. I used a telephone
   to, like, call my broker yesterday, and y'know, just /after/ I'd
   ordered those 2000 shares of Nortel ...""
You just gotta love a mass-delusion like that.
Although it's like a total shock to 99.999% (5nines) of all the
employed website designers out there, the truth is webforms /can/
accept ""U.S. of A"" as a country.  Incredible, but true.  Web forms can
also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can
even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's
Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor
locking your business into their ""small transaction fee"" tithe.
Of course, try and tell one of those 5-niners that and they'll get all
defensive, black list you as a sh*t disturber and undermine your
reputation with the boss...  not that I'm speaking first-hand or
anything ;)

*SHIVER MY TIMBERS*

/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""

This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.

It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".
It seems implausible to me that ""shiver"" here means ""to shake""; I don't
recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913
lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of
""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the
1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means
""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"".
Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.
(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,
leaves you with a sinking boat.)
So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more
vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do.""  The interpretation
suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much
sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.
I've sent a copy of this to Quinion.",1378,spam

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure
Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

Pricing..
BonFire is free,

Performance:
The main premise behind BonFire is anonymity to hide your IP
connection.
This has been achieved without any sacrifice in email delivery speed.
Best results are on Cable, ADSL, DSL, T1, or a T3 connection,
but a dialup connection will work just fine.
The type of email lists you use may also affect the software's
performance.
Single domain lists will mail faster than a mixed domain email list.
A smaller message puts less strain on the mail servers,
therefore, smaller messages mean faster delivery.
A small text or html message is all you need,
to get your customers attention.
An eye catching subject line is also very important.
BonFire will send either html or text messages.
You can also control the BCC count.
Just check a few boxes and send yourself some messages as a test..
You'll see for yourself the great value of the BonFire mailer.

Let's say you're behind a firewall and have a NAT address.
Is there any way to telnet to a linux box out there in the world
and set your DISPLAY in some way that you can create

I'm in no way a pro but perhaps you could set your Firewall to accept connections from that Linux box and then somehow set the Linux box to transmit on a specific port. Then configure your router to forward all information from that port to your box.

All of these ""af6"" are related to avifile6 support :-/
Normally, my 0.6.1-fr2 build of transcode defaults to *not* use avifile,
but you can use ""--with avifile6"" to force recompiling against it.

Do you have an old avifile installed maybe?
Can you check the ""./configure ..."" line run at the beginning of the
rebuild process to see if it does include the ""--without-avifile6"" option?

Yes it was there.
You guessed the problem correctly in an earlier e-mail There was still
remnants remaining from an old failed avifile installation.
The transcode src.rpm now builds perfectly.
Thank you VERY much!
You are GOOD.

Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes
By Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01
If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.
But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.
Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
can't get the chicks with that anymore.""
The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.
The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.
The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.
""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""
At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.
Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.
The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.
But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.
""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job.""
Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.
""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""
Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.
""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""
Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.
""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation.""
Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.
""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along.""
Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.
""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""",1020,ham

Chris, is this related to your recent changes?
Curious.  I changed the arguments to Ftoc_ShowSequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  Somehow your version 
of ScanFolder is still trying to pass $F.  You seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).
I don't know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely

Do you think it is really useful to combat hysterical right-wing 
propoganda with hysterical left-wing propoganda?

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical
right wing propaganda"" spew forth, while reaching for their gun

my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting

My impression is that France is not anywhere near the ""Permit Raj""

like India's has.
But De Soto's work is perhaps just as important or more so.  He hasn't
dealt specifically with India, but I recall examples from Peru,
Philippines, and Egypt.  In Lima, his team took over a year (I think it
was 2) working 8 hr days to legally register a 1 person company.  
In the
Philippines, getting legal title can take 20 years.  In Egypt, 
about 80%
of the population in Cairo lives in places where they are officially
illegal.
India hasn't been helped by its socialism.  Socialism has certainly
helped strangle the country in permits.  But perhaps De Soto is right
that the real crippling thing is keeping most of the people out of the
legal, official property system.
Putting most of the people in the property system was something

easy, but we live in a society that doesn't even remember we did it.

Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).
==============
The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of
HTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height
properties, then multiply them together and add the result to the
running total.

Spam % of all rules with S/O > 0.90: 31.25%
========================
I figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only
have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
consecutive IMGs within a message.
This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.

ham,"This is happening due to insufficient write access to the
""razor-agent.log"" file. I was getting the same error, but
only as a non-root user.  As a quick workaround, you can do
""chmod go+w razor-agent.log"".
In Agent.pm, when then the Logger object is created, it
doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user. Then, when a write attempt is made, it bails out with
the ""unblessed reference"" error.
Hope that helps,

I just noticed the following log entries in my syslog with the latest
Spamassassin CVS (set up using spamc/spamd) and razor-agents 2.14:
Jul 26 17:30:09 timmy spamd[54928]: razor2 check skipped: No such file or

/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client/Agent.pm line 211,

I saw this after checking if my upgrade from razor-agents 2.12 to 2.14 went
okay, but the problem is still there after downgrading back to 2.12.  I
don't really know when this started happening, :-/
Any ideas on the problem?

I have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail.  The binding looks like this:
set {bindings(key,HD_Dist_Silently -form distcomps.to-me)} <Meta-dollar>
The ""HD_Dist_Silently"" is a hacked up version of the proc that 
does dist in exmh and is pasted in below.  It's getting old and 
probably should be ""resynced"" with the current code.  But it 
still works (on a relatively recent CVS copy of exmh)
It's also possible that there's an easier way but I hacked this 
together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked I moved 
on to other tasks.
--Hal

    global exmh msg

I doubt it's related, actually -- the ""triplets"" stuff is in a totally
unrelated area of code.
The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.
So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't

PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.
This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.
Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:
a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 
All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  
WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 
So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.
The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.
Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something on the side that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!

The new ish of Strange Horizons in out, with an interview with Bloodhag, the 
most metal of the all the science fiction metal bands. 
    Soon, the spotlight comes up again. The lead singer grabs the microphone. 
    ""This is Frank Bellknap Long!"" he yells, and, feverish, launches into a 
    lecture on Long's oeuvre. There can't be more than a handful of people on 
    this earth who could get a beer-sodden thrash crowd to listen to an English 
    Lit lecture. Thirty seconds later, the audience is sufficiently educated, 
    and the guys begin to wail. Jake the singer holds the microphone over his 
    head and belts out the song in a growling voice that's monster-movie low. 
    ""No reason! No corners!"" he shouts. Two minutes later, they're done with 
    the pulps and ready to move on to the New Wave. ""Our next song is about 
    Harlan Ellison!"" Jake bellows, and the geeks, the hipsters, the metalheads, 
    and the drunks let out a howl of mutual joy. 
    Bldhag -- note the dual umlauts -- hails from Seattle. Describing 
    themselves as ""edu-core,"" the band performs nothing but two-minute thrash 
    tributes to science fiction writers. Between songs, the band pelts the 
    audience with paperback books, quizzes them on book titles, and demands 
    that the audience show their library cards. Their motto: ""The Faster You Go 
    Deaf, the More Time You Have to Read.""

*Motions Filed in Morpheus Peer-to-Peer Case
Judge to Consider Legality of Gnutella Software
Los Angeles - Attorneys for StreamCast Networks, developers of the
popular Morpheus peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing software, filed
briefs in federal court on Monday seeking a ruling that distribution
of the software does not violate copyright law.
Morpheus is a popular file-sharing application based on the
decentralized Gnutella P2P networking protocol.
In their briefs seeking summary judgment, attorneys from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the law firm of Brobeck,
Phleger and Harrison argued that distribution of the software is legal
because the product is capable of substantial noninfringing uses and
because StreamCast cannot control the various uses of the software.
Supporting StreamCast in the motion is nine time Grammy nominee Janis
Ian, who believes that peer-to-peer software represents important new
opportunities for artists.
On October 2, 2001, 28 of the world's largest entertainment companies
sued StreamCast for the allegedly infringing actions of users of its
product (MGM et al v. Grokster et al, Case No. 01-CV-8541 SVW).
Additional briefs will be filed in the months to come, with oral
arguments set for December 2, 2002, before U.S. Federal District Court
Judge Stephen Wilson in Los Angeles.

*Electronic Frontier Foundation Holds Second Annual Share-In
John Perry Barlow, Mountain Girl Garcia Host Free Music Fest
San Francisco - Join the Electronic Frontier Foundation and five Bay
Area bands for an afternoon of live music and outdoor fun at EFF's
second annual Share-In. The festival will be held in Golden Gate
Park's Music Concourse Bandshell on Saturday, September 14th from noon
- 5pm. The celebration of independent music will be hosted by Grateful
Dead lyricist and EFF co-founder John Perry Barlow and former wife of
the late great Jerry Garcia, Mountain Girl Garcia.
Artists participating in this event will permit recording of their
performances by those in attendance in support of EFFs Open Audio
License (OAL). Musicians performing at the event include: the Box Set
Duo - clown princes of folk-rock, the classic funk band Funkmonsters,
celtic world-fusion group Hy Brassyl, harmony based folk-pop band
Atticus Scout, and Berkeley-based party band Shady Lady.
In addition to music, the Share-In will feature performers including
Ashley Foster the One Wheeled Wonder, the Existential Circus,
Frantastic Hands, the Metronome Dancers, and Willy Bologna and his
Sideshow Circus. Bring your family and friends!
Ben and Jerry's will sell their famous ice cream, and Cartwheel
Catering will be on site with hot dogs, pretzels, and churros.
Proceeds from the Share-In will go directly to EFF's Campaign for
Audiovisual Free Expression (CAFE), which oversees projects such as
the Open Audio License. CAFE empowers the creative community in
cyberspace by protecting the public's access to and use of audiovisual
technologies.
The Open Audio License is a tool that EFF has developed in order to
help artists share music more directly with their fans, without
sacrificing recognition for their creativity. The OAL encourages
collaboration, providing artists with an alternative to a business
model strictly driven by profit. Based on the open source and free
software initiatives for software development, the OAL encourages
artists to share with one another and their fans
Adoption of the OAL does not mean that artists go unrewarded for their
work. On the contrary, the OAL permits artists to share single tracks
or performances and gain widespread recognition for their work without
relying on intermediaries. EFF encourages new models of music
distribution in the digital world that benefit the artists themselves.
The Internet makes it possible to drastically reduce the overhead for
packaging and distributing music, which is where record companies
currently spend most of the money that could be going to artists. EFF
is committed to developing tools that empower artists to take control
over their own art and to be compensated appropriately for their works.
When: Saturday, September 14th, Noon-5pm
Where: Music Concourse Bandshell in Golden Gate Park, near the
Japanese Tea Gardens between MLK Drive and JFK Drive

Could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the
humanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms
per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength
enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel?  
This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need
to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or
carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under
weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength
cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
muscular enhancement.
    E> As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK
    E> not really well explained in the comic series. 
If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure
modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to
think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then
what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout
the entire nervous system.  
Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly
hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal
sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,
everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle
hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;
don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We
know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time
was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself
already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination.
Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine
if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological
'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but
just the ""driver of the bus"".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his
self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
cognitive time-scales.

ham,"I think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
for mail messages.  The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
or easy-to-customize tokenizer.
The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use.  I'd like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.
I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data.  If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others.

I've very excited about the in-planning Penguin Shell volunteer project. 
Apparently, you are too. I've received more than 100 emails from readers
volunteering
a wide range of IT skills for charitable organizations. 
Linux users, Windows users, even a few Mac users are ready, willing and able to 
spend their own precious off time providing qualified technical skills for a 
good cause. I've also gotten more than two dozen suggestions for
organizations
that might be in need of such skills. And, I've 
seen some very interesting suggestions for
names
for our project. Feel free to click through on any of the 
above links to join the ever-growing bandwagon. Do me a favor, though. keep the 
subject lines intact. It's the only way your messages will filter and sort 
through my email system.
It looks like Apple may have crossed a line of irritation with its users. 
According to
this
article on
The Register
, Apple has tacked a $100 annual fee on its
previously free mac.com email service. It's also set the price for an OS 10.2
upgrade at $129.
I won't question Apple's decision too much. Instead, it really proves how 
difficult things have become in the tech world in the past few years. Revenues, 
by and large, are still decreasing from the pie-in-the-sky late 90s and early 
2000. That's left companies to scramble for new sources of income, some of which 
were previously free. Even we at Lockergnome have felt the pinch in the past few 
years. Never fear, though. Chris has assured us that the newsletters will remain 
free. We have, however, begun to explore alternative income
sources
.
On a brighter note, it looks like
Mandrake
has found a sweet spot. According to their most 
recent shareholder's report, the third quarter was the strongest in the 
company's
history, with 1.6 million Euro (1.61 million US) in revenue. That doesn't put
them in the black, though. According to MandrakeSoft, the strong quarter will
only decrease operating losses. I have to wonder how much of this revenue was
the result of the
Mandrake Linux User's
Club
.
The news also makes me want to pay a bit more attention to Mandrake's newest
partnership venture, an agreement with
Microtel
to provide Mandrake-loaded computers for sale on
WalMart.com
.
I would never have guessed that WalMart would lead the consumer Linux machine
charge. They've had Mandrake boxes available for several months. Now, with the 
addition of both
Lindows
and Mandrake-equipped computers, they seem surprisingly ahead of the retail 
computer pack. Let's hope for the best for all involved.
Have a great Wednesday.

Checking Mail With KMail
I've recently become a KDE convert - impressed enough with KDE-3 to move me from 
my longtime desktop friend Gnome. While I use a combination of fetchmail, 
procmail and pine for reading and filtering my email, KMail is a strong 
contender in the email race. As you'd guess, it's fully integrated into the KDE 
desktop, ready for a quick setup and easy use.
There's one drawback to KMail, though, in my opionion. That's that it doesn't 
automatically check your email by default when the program is opened. As much 
time as I spend talking about saving key and mouse strokes, you knew the 
additional step to check your email after opening the program would be an 
irritation to this Penguin. However, changing the problem is a quick and simple 
configuration issue.
To force KMail to check your email when opened, right-click on the KMail icon in 
your KDE panel. Select ""Preferences"" and the ""Execute"" tab. In the Execute 
window, change the command line to read:
kmail --check -caption ""%c"" %i %m
The addition of the --check option will force KMail to bring you your mail when 
you open the program.
Fewer keystrokes make a happy geek, right?

Kernel Configuration - Part XIII
As you well know, Linux is simply the most robust operating system for 
networking around. With its roots squarely in the network, Linux has managed to 
stay ahead of the pack in virtually every respect related to networks. It should 
come as little suprise, then, that the network section of your Linux kernel 
configuration is dense with details and options.
I will say that I warned you on Monday - there are going to be some sections of 
the kernel configuration series where I just can't give you a stock 
configuration that will work in every case. Networking is one of those areas. 
You're going to have to give some thought as to how your network is or will be 
used and the level of security you want to provide (both internal and external). 
Then, it's a matter of finding the solutions to those options.
For security issues, I can recommend several good articles and HowTos:
The Linux Security Quickstart HowTo
covers security on a high level, with a good discussion of kernel 
configuration issues
Linux Network Security from Linux Planet
a nice tutorial on network security
Network Security with /proc/sys/net/ipv4
other approaches to network security
These should get you started. Tomorrow, we'll cover telephony support in your 
Linux kernel.

Linux PR
http://linuxpr.com/
If the daily Linux news sites are starting to get you down, maybe it's time for 
a change. Linux PR is an up-to-the-minute listing of events and developments in 
the Linux world. The layout is attractive, with all the most recent articles in 
descending order on the front page. It makes quick scans easy. The only real 
downside to the news on the site is that some of it is very, very 
company-oriented - clearly the work of PR firms cranking out press releases. 
Other than that, Linux PR is a useful site for checking in and keeping up on 
your favorite OS.

So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) 
If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. 
So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. 
There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice. 
Oops.

An island in Tracadie harbour is about to become the Nova Scotia getaway
for movie stars Ethan Hawke

and Uma Thurman
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/1347.htm?newsletter=number48>
and their two children. Owner Marie Kelly confirmed she is finalizing
the sale of her 3.6-hectare island, which comes complete with two
cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination.

actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
Proof, says: ""British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake."" Gwyneth,
previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt

and Ben Affleck

accepted with pleasure. One of her ""very charming"" dates was actor James
Purefoy
<http://www.tribute.ca/all_actors/bios/4090.htm?newsletter=number48> ,
who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.

Muscle-bound Vin Diesel

star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
he was so taken by Entertainment Tonight reporter, Maria Manounos, that
he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was ""available"".
It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the
day.

How have you been? If you've been like me, you've been trying
trying almost EVERYTHING to lose weight.  I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either.  It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.
You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!""  Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try.  I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight!  Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all.  Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!
I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount. I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!
If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!
You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""
Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 
Here is the bottom line ...
I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day.  
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain!  You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED.  This is my
pledge to you.
BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more!

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.
also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says ""converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW"".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)
don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, ""the more the merrier"". ;-)
You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.
AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.
Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).
anyways...

And if a spammer forges headers???
Header forgeries are trivially easy to detect. The main way that 
spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, 
but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that 
spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the 
originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, 
and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many 
ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.
One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, 
and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a 
fairly good indication of spam.  Tracking a spammer to his 
meatspace location is not as difficult as you might think, once 
you have legal recourse to subpoena records.

....and with the crucial hair feature enabled!
That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature"" 
improves my day immeasurably.
I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting 
thing.   It seriously loses for reasons like Rohit's just encountered.   
One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.
I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.
I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....
You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
ick!"" when you might have a great time together.
We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.
Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.
An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in 
the company of a variety of people, compressed into one event.   I think 
it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a 
project together, cooking, climbing a mountain or whatever.
It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. 
I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
actually sound.

I am a serious officer with one of our main branches of CITI BANK,

However, based on the standard value place on everything about you,  I believed we could discuss, analyze and execute this transaction.The transaction is thus:
I've a wealthy client, an American Citizen who had been residing in West Africa for decades now, he operates a fix deposit account with us which I am his account officer, and also 
receives standing orders  for his chains of dividends share.
However, this client Mr. David Brown died as an  out come of Heart attack,and the funds in his current account has  been claimed by his family, who had gone back finally to USA.
At the end of Fiscal year, March 2001, an  accumulated share of US$12.360M was transferred into his account from the Stock Exchange.
This was alone the instructions we issued to the Stock House to dispose all his stocks.
Now the funds has arrived, I needed an associate whom I would present as the inheritor of this fund i.e. Associate partner of Mr. David Brown so as to receive this fund.
Please note, his family has left since,and never  know about this stocks in the exchange and the funds has subsequently matured in his Fix Deposit Account, so I as the account officer 
has prepared all documents for easy claims of this fund.
Immediately, you reach me, I will furnish you  with further details and then negotiate on the sharing ratio once you show your sincere involvement to go along with me. It will be of 
need for you to furnish me also your personal phone and fax  numbers for urgent
messages. 
I am anxiously waiting to hear your consent. 
Be guided.

Haha!!!
Just a few notes:
 - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone
   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.
SA (and other filters) could be configured to ignore the SWE mark if it 
appears to come from/through China.
 - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.
SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that 
look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still 
mean that ""The U.N. is going to invade America!"" spams with SWE would get 
through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.

 From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.
Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).
Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.

Sure thing :)
Cool :-)
I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at
build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a

	rpmbuild --recompile <rpm> --without oss --without isapnp
OK, I'll add this.
Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package
installed.  I've added a flag ""kernsrc"", that also can be used
--without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It
would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
(/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm
a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file
not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way
to do that.
Requiring a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possible, no, except
maybe by stopping the build process if it isn't found... but that's errr...
ugly!
And I really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources, the
easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too...
I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards
option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found
out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM
docs don't help much.
This would be a tricky one since to use the ""--with <name>"" feature of
rpmbuild, I think you'd need to add individual handling of each and every
card :-/
Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of
alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply
the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules
from source.  It created the /dev files and all.
That's what the ""alsa-driver"" is there for, create all the base files
excluding the kernel drivers. What I would suggest for dependency reasons
it to install an ""alsa-kernel"" for the original kernel (you've kept it,
right? ;-)) and install ALSA modules from source for custom kernels built
from source.
Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild
the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec:

rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp
--without kernsrc

But I get this:

==[long successful compile snipped]====================================> RPM build errors:
      File listed twice: /dev/adsp
      File listed twice: /dev/amidi
      Installed (but unpackaged) file(s) found:
     /etc/makedev.d/00macros
     /etc/rc.d/init.d/alsasound
=======================================================================> 
Oh, and I think I've forgot to mention, I'm running beta-null :).
Indeed : The rpm 4.1 snapshot in (null) has a few new features among which
having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not
listed in the %files section. I should remove them manually as part of the
build process... or maybe the new ""%exclude /path/to/file"" in the %files
section would do, but I don't know how older versions of rpm would handle
it. On my (null) build system, I've simply set the variable :
%_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0

argh, they do not, do they?   the FPs must be just gigantic :(
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.
Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.
Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.

I posted a fairly lengthy complete answer to this problem and how to
get around it in SA 2.41 on the spamassassin-talk list. :)
Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.
Now for a razor question:
I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.
Thanks,
Dave

 Emigrate to Russia? That's a steppe too far
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 So you think you've got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham
 or sick of Sheffield.
 
 Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey
 this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps
 heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.
 
 Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied
 with life in Blair's Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to
 emigrate to provincial Russia.
 
 After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek
 article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other
 side.
 
 ""The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city
 deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said Kommersant.
 
 ""In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly
 cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are
 becoming 'traditionally' relaxed.""
 
 The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of
 tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.
 
 It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the
 famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also
 opening time in the nation's vodka shops.
 
 And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that
 ""the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be
 enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their
 life.
 
 ""The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle
 of whisky for kopecks.""
 
 There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a
 halfpenny in sterling.
 
 The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton
 will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine
 vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among
 diehard alcoholics.
 
 While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The
 newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail
 soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British
 settler should overcome the difficulty.
 
 ""For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut
 off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle.""
 
 One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There
 are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the
 Mongolian border.
 
 However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a
 deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in
 which they would like to live.
 
 France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country ""where English is only known
 by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists"".
 
 Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian
 weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.
 
 Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.
 And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place
 in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures
 that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the
 permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.
 
 Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the
 climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will
 solve itself"".
 
 Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in
 Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.
 
 ""Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33
 million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found
 amongst our citizens.""
 
 Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons
 surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their
 preferred new home.

S
omatotropin 
                    (aka Growth Factor, hGH, HGH, Growth Hormone, GH, Human Growth 
                    Hormone) is naturally produced by the anterior pituitary gland 
                    in the brain and declines with age, so it is a natural substance 
                    already in your body right this moment. HGH is known as the 
                    master hormone because it exerts effects over all other hormones 
                    in the body, including Testosterone, Estrogen, Progesterone 
                    and DHEA. Augmenting declining somatotropin levels by giving 
                    your body daily ingestible somatotropin, can create a more 
                    youthful hormone balance that results in dramatic improvements 
                    in your health.
Somatotropin supplementation 
                    is a life-enhancement. Lives that were once shattered by fatigue, 
                    illness or the ravages of aging, now fourish with the help 
                    of somatotropin supplementation.
Somatotropin from the pituitary 
                    works by stimulating protein production in all tissues of 
                    the body. This results in an increase in organ healing and 
                    regeneration, which is associated with increase resistance 
                    to illness and injury.
No matter your age, we GUARANTEE
you will look and feel BETTER than
you ever imagined possible.

An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html
http://www.snopes.com/quotes/bush.htm
Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""
Status:   False.
Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""
The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.
Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""
This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.
Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

My next (current) task is to complete the corpus I've got - it's currently
got ~ 9000 ham, 7800 spam, and about 9200 currently unsorted. I'm tossing 
up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  - previously
I've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to 
pop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too, too
tedious.
I can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of
the more 'interesting' uglies. One thing I've seen (consider this 
'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the

Slaughter in the Name of God
By Salman Rushdie
Friday, March 8, 2002; Page A33 Washington Post
The defining image of the week, for me, is of a small child's burned and 
blackened arm, its tiny fingers curled into a fist, protruding from the 
remains of a human bonfire in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, in India. The murder 
of children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily 
killings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in 
Nellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring 
village . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the 
horrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi's assassination: 
They bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in 
evidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in 
kerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or 
smothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length 
of wood.
I say ""our"" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves 
India deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is 
potentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India's 
strengths, then India's sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? 
Good. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India 
undergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a 
decade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed 
or disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men's 
unwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to 
religion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to 
the same sentiments as the nation in general.
Meanwhile, India's political masters have been tut-tutting and offering 
the usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. 
(It has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya 
Janata Party (BJP), or Indian People's Party, and the Hindu extremists 
of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister 
organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some 
international commentators, such as Britain's Independent newspaper, 
urge us to ""beware excess pessimism.""
The horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we're used 
to it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That's how life is, 
folks. Most of the time India is the world's largest secular democracy; 
and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we 
mustn't let that distort the picture.
Of course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, 
when a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which 
they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu 
fanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some 
Muslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the 
train-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes 
of the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the 
partition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists' hands.
The VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and 
insufficient radicalism of India's BJP government. Prime Minister Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a 
coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP's 
more extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. 
But it isn't working anymore. In state elections across the country, the 
BJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP 
firebrands. Why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic 
agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success?
The electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark 
that lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the 
site of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that's where the Godhra dead 
were coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, 
tragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee 
has insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and 
wrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.
The distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India's 
president, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP 
hard-liner) as well as the central government for doing ""too little too 
late."" She pins the blame firmly on the ""motivated, well-planned out and 
provocative actions"" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the 
Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the 
violence erupted, denounced India's Muslims en masse and praised the 
nationalist movement.
The murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in 
her letter demands ""stern legal action"" against them. But the VHP is 
determined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such 
public pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting 
them, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces 
the Nobel award.
The political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there's 
something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face: 
namely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is 
the poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no 
excuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in 
the fashionable language of ""respect."" What is there to respect in any 
of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around 
the world in religion's dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, 
religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And 
when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results 
makes it easier to do it again.
So India's problem turns out to be the world's problem. What happened in 
India has happened in God's name. The problem's name is God.

Greens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they
would have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their
fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial
civilization.
The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming
theorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the
temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have
been validated with a different means of measurement.
Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global
warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the
""Medieval Warm Period"".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,
and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.
In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused
DIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,
and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have
your warming theory.
Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over
long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback
loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.
More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more
clouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great
deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit
they do clouds very poorly.

For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain
why
the
dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers
are
melting faster than they have previously in the historical record.
That
is,
people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate
explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).

Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.
Andrew Brandt
From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002
The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.
Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.
And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.
Now for a razor question:
I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.
Thanks,
Dave

Yet another case where 'marriage' is actually an inappropriate word
for these guys.  What they want is 'housekeeper' 'dog' and

All I can say, is I hope these girls come out, take the men for what

ALB> Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
ALB> By Andrew Marshall
ALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.
ALB> ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
ALB> knew then there was something special.""
ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
ALB> who is expecting their first child.
ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
ALB> in search of a wife.
ALB> ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""
ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
ALB> the couple married.
ALB> MR. MARRIAGE
ALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
ALB> agency.
ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.
ALB> ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.""
ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.
ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
ALB> language problems.
ALB> ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
ALB> Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""
ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
ALB> client has found a potential wife.
ALB> ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
ALB> think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
ALB> usually within the next year.
ALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
ALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
ALB> than 10 percent have broken up.
ALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.
ALB> ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.""'
ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
ALB> stress disorder.
ALB> WHY?
ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.
ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
ALB> no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
ALB> need Wan,"" he said.
ALB> ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
ALB> their future husband.""
ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
ALB> choose to use his agency.
ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
ALB> singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
ALB> not ""God's gift to women.""
ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.
ALB> ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
ALB> Impossible,"" she said.
ALB> ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ALB> ladies from other countries.""
ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
ALB> not a major obstacle.
ALB> ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
ALB> a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
ALB> very quickly.""
ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
ALB> to the West.
ALB> ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.""
ALB> PITFALLS
ALB> But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.
ALB> ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
ALB> spoke to me.""
ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
ALB> there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""
ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.
ALB> ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
ALB> comers.""
ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
ALB> looking for a foreign husband.
ALB> ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
ALB> Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 
Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 
[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 
The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 
In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 
And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 
I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 
*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  
Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 
*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 
- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""
*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

Dear Fool,
Just before Enron plunged...
...16 of 17 Wall Street analysts were still urging you 
to buy Enron's stock.  While the company piled up debt 
and manufactured imaginary earnings, auditors gave the 
balance sheet a big thumbs-up.  As investors lost 
everything, Enron insiders pocketed millions.
AND THAT should make every investor's blood boil!
Frankly, the Enrons and Global Crossings of the world 
infuriate me.  All the backroom manipulations dirty 
dealing and cover-ups really make it hard to know who 
you can trust.   And that is why we've created a NEW 
investing service, ""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool 
Stock Advisor"" -- to bring the Motley Fool co-founders' 
extraordinary commitment to honest stock analysis, 
fair dealing and complete disclosure to investors like 
you on a regular and timely basis.
The Motley Fool, which David and Tom founded back in 
1993, is dedicated to the principle that given the 
right tools...the average guy can find great success in 
every aspect of his financial life.
And now, David and Tom are applying this principle -- and 
their extensive investing experience -- to the new 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor.""  
But as you'll see, this service isn't just about 
""buying more stocks.""  OUR GOAL in publishing the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" is twofold:  To help you 
gain the knowledge, confidence and resolve to make 
money in the U.S. stock market...while avoiding the 
biggest mistakes, as well.
The Wall Street analysts touting Global Crossing said 
its worldwide fiber-optics network would make it the 
king of telecom.  Now these shares are WORTH NOTHING.  
Microstrategy was the poster child of the technology 
bubble-after earnings restatements, the stock now sits 
99% OFF its high!  Kmart's lousy inventory management 
and marketing incompetence helped drive the company 
into BANKRUPTCY.
WHAT ABOUT Nortel and Lucent-two of America's most 
widely owned stocks.  Will they ever come back?  How 
about AOL?  Does its merger with Time-Warner mean the 
GLORY DAYS are over -- or have they just begun?   Are 90% 
of all telecommunications companies truly in danger of 
disappearing? If so, which will survive? Will great 
old names like JP Morgan, Disney and Motorola recover?  
Well, those are the sorts of questions David & Tom 
Gardner can help you answer at the ""Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.""  
As they say, ""Show us the money.""  When it comes to 
making promises, fast-talkers can fudge just about 
anything.  But CASH FLOW doesn't lie.
YOU CAN avoid a lot of big mistakes by simply making 
sure a company has the cash coming in to pay its 
bills.  And watching cash flow is also one of the best 
ways to identify superstar companies -- far more reliable 
than ""earnings"" that can be manipulated 8 ways to 
Sunday.  Once you eliminate big losers from the 
equation -- and target the true superstars -- you'll find 
investing more fun...less stressful...and much more 
profitable, as well.
So forget about Wall Street's ""damaged goods""-
companies that have a boatload of debt and accounting 
woes, as well.  Keep it SIMPLE instead.
""Simple"" means investing in companies that we all -- with 
a little effort -- can understand.  Companies where we 
know what businesses they're really in.  Companies 
where the financial statements actually mean 
something.  And companies easily recognizable as the 
""best of breed.""
In the free report you received, ""The One Stock That 
Keeps Wall Street BUZZING,"" you read about one of 
David & Tom's very favorite investments: Starbucks.  
Before this company came along, most folks just took 
coffee for granted.  And certainly, no one proposed 
any far-reaching business model built around it.  Yet 
these innovators took a low-margin commodity and built 
a near $3 BILLION company with more than 5000 
retail outfits all around the world.
Starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on 
money it has earned from existing ones. That is an 
astounding testament to its economic power.  At The 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor we'll help you find and 
truly understand the great investments, the companies 
with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects.   
Right now we're following companies such as:
*America's most prestigious jeweler -- its brand name 
has no rival.  With net margins of 59% on sales of 
$1.6 Billion, this company is a great pick for solid 
returns with low risk.   
*This software company commands more than 25% of the 
video game market.  Its shares have returned 6,000% 
since its public debut in 1989.  An investment of 
$5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000.  The video 
game market is expected to double by 2005 with this 
company enjoying the lion's share of the growth.
*This premier credit rating company has locked-in 
demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of 
borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt.  
It has a 20-year record of consistent sales and income 
growth and is poised for another stellar year.
YOU CAN TRY the ""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" for six 
full months 100% RISK-FREE.  If we don't prove its 
worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime.
As a Charter Subscriber, you get the ""Motley Fool

Sincerely yours,
Mike Bell, Publisher
""David & Tom Gardner's Motley Fool Stock Advisor""
P.S. Do you like BIG PROFITS?  In 1994, investment 
pros sniffed at America Online's high-flying stock and 
screamed, ""Overvalued.""  But the Gardners saw three 
things they overlooked: 1) AOL was building the 
premier stop in cyberspace; 2) They had a great 
retention strategy; and 3) Millions of members paying 
$$$ every month.
So Tom and David bought it.  And today they're sitting 
on whopping 4,120% gains.  So you see, while they do 
structure their investing strategy to avoid big 
blunders...they do make a lot of money, too.  To try the 
""Motley Fool Stock Advisor"" RISK-FREE, click here now:

NEW PATENTED PRODUCT is designed to REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE & REJUVENATE TISSUE! 
Successfully addresses WRINKLES, DARK CIRCLES, AGE SPOTS, FINE LINES, LESIONS, SPIDER VEINS, SKIN TAGS, SCAR TISSUE, CELLULITE, STRETCH MARKS, and MORE for most people the LookGoodDuo is Hypoallergenic !
Research, which began many years ago, has concluded that ellagic acid, derived from a compound called ellagitannins, is a very powerful substance. The highest concentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. The delivery of the ellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. We use raspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the ONLY method that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants. 
Ellagic acid from raspberry seed ellagitannins is the most powerful and complete polyphenolic, phytoestrogen, antioxidant material yet discovered! These plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed, provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation. 
It is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment. The results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes. These materials also help to decrease the appearance of ""AGE"" brown spots, while smoothing WRINKLES, strengthening HAIR and NAILS, and supporting many other significant health issues! 
CELLULITE is simply FAT that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens. The phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants from both ORAL and TOPICAL sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface. 
We offer this Patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream. Taken both internally and externally, it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly, working from the inside-out AND from the outside-in.  Happy users report a healthy GLOW which they have never achieved with any other product! 
PRODUCT TESTIMONIALS 
I've been using the product for a little over a month. I took the ""2 face challenge', and I could tell a difference in only 3 days! The lines on my face and the pores had changed!  I have had people compliment my fingernails. They have been growing like crazy!  C.C., OH
This is a unique, one of a kind product.   I have been using it 3 weeks and I can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. The prescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.  M.F., MS
I have been watching myself very closely, and since using the product, the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared. The smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up. No more problems putting my eyeliner on! The skin under my chin has really tightened up.  This is not hard work, it is just sharing the product with family and friends. I have never been rewarded so quickly and so well.   E.P., CA
K.D., TX 
I was queen of skeptical.  I did not want to try this.  I am a 54 yr old grandmother.  I have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked.  My husband kept telling me to try this.  Finally I did it just to get him off my back.  I had not worn shorts for 5 years.  After about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs were looking better.  I thought he was just being nice since he got me into this.   Then I went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in a long time I looked pretty good.  I went into the next dressing room, because I thought the lights were wrong, but I still looked good.  I ended up buying shorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years.  Yes, it works!! G.C., TX
We just had a booth at the womens expo in Dallas.  Out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food.   V.C., TX
I did the 1 side of the face test, and I did not tell my spouse that I was doing it.  We went to get some  fast food.  He was looking at me, and said I can tell you which side you are using it on.  Its your right side.  I asked what made him think so, and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened, and the fine lines around my neck.  We are tickled, because everyone we talk to wants it!  J.D., TX 
After using your product for less than a week, I ran into a friend who asked me what I was doing to look so YOUNG!  I have a full- time job, but I have made $8,000 since starting this business part time!   T.H.,Tx

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm

Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.
Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.
Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )
So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.
The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose

There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the
hundred-thousand-hectares).
It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural
curiousity and fascination with watching advertising from the rest of
the world. Maybe they're downloading Bjork videos.

Second, one could make the assumption that ancient or future civilizations
would not be hydrocarbon based. There are alternative fuel sources,
including seabed methane, biomass and all the usual suspects -- solar,
hydro etc. Some of these could be exploited on a decidedly low-tech (ie,
emergent civilization) basis. However, it is difficult to conceive of an
industrial civilization that doesn't employ wheels, axles and bearings,
all of which require lubrication. I'm not an engineer (Robin, anyone?) but
it's my understanding that vegetable lubrication breaks down under stress,
and that oil or graphite lubricants are the only reasonable choices for
high temperature/high rotation applications, at least prior to extremely
advanced modes of chemical synthesis.
This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon
products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as
a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -
there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,
but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 
much more easily within the petrochemical industry.
Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower
oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 
war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from
waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. 
Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 
petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 
of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously
being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 
matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock
oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the
gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 
cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.
My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.
Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals
(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 
difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the
petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect
that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,
just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,
for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.
All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling
like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

DNA's idea of fads is on the 100 kiloyear scale, unfortunately. As long as
current fads don't involve in-vivo rewrite of the genome, homeoboxes
including (now there's a problem for you, homeoboxing the adult), they're
not all that smart an idear.

Art is sure nice. However, if art is our first priority we're kinda
fux0red, if we've set our sight on a sustainable culture.
Nah, didn't say art's our priority.  Said our ideas about relationships 
and love are.

Our firmware is not built to be single-parented. You can counteract that
somewhat by exposing the kid to a community of close friends, but not too
many do that.
I see it a lot in the south. Also family.

I don't know what exactly is wrong, but something is definitely wrong.  
This is way too important to be left to just our intuition of what is
right and what is wrong.
One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.

Techs fall with consumer sentiment
A drop in the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index helped put a dent in technology shares Friday.
Despite Dell Computer raising its outlook and better-than-expected earnings from Juniper Networks, CNET's Tech index slipped 5.12 points, or 0.51 percent, to 990.0. The tech-packed Nasdaq composite index edged down 0.94 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,373.49.
Broader markets also fell, as investors shrugged off news of better-than-expected retail and food services sales in June. The Dow Jones industrials shed 117 points, or 1.33 percent, to 8,684.5--its fifth straight losing session. The S&P 500 lost 5.98 points, or 0.64 percent, to 921.39.
Rivals help improve Dell's outlook
Dell Computer on Thursday raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the second quarter, saying it continues to gain market share from computer rivals.
The company said it now expects revenue for the quarter that ends Aug. 2 will reach $8.3 billion, up about 9 percent from last year's second quarter, with earnings of 19 cents per share. On May 16, the company predicted revenue would hit $8.2 billion and projected earnings at 18 cents per share.
DELL COMPUTER CORP 24.98 4.39%
Lukewarm response to Juniper moves
Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.
JUNIPER NETWORKS 7.70 6.65%
Asia proves sweet spot for Yahoo
Web portal Yahoo, which broke a long streak of losses in the second quarter, said it hopes to ride on Asia's acceptance of online advertising and focus on wireless content to boost its regional business.
""Asian advertisers who use traditional media like newspapers and TV are moving more into online ads as they see the value and efficiency that it delivers,"" Niren Hiro, Yahoo's general manager for Southeast Asia, said in an interview Thursday. ""That's why we've seen in the last quarter clients who have traditionally stayed away from new media like us starting to divert their budgets in our direction.""

J.P. Morgan downgrades Powerwave Technologies to ""long-term buy"" in tech notes 7/12/02
Analyst Ed Snyder lowers his rating from ""buy"" despite a strong quarter from the wireless communications gear maker. Powerwave has a diversified customer base and fewer competitors now, Snyder suggests. But he cuts his estimates and rating based on lower guidance from the company, weak third-generation (3G) wireless network orders, and likely cuts in carrier capital expenditures. The infrastructure market remains lumpy and hard to predict, Snyder says.

AOL on the hunt for new CEO
AOL Time Warner has begun casting a net for a chief executive for its beleaguered America Online division.
The move comes as no surprise. Former AOL CEO Barry Schuler stepped down from the position in April. But it raises questions about the future of Robert Pittman, AOL Time Warner's chief operating officer and the interim head of AOL. Pittman had been charged with fixing the division. As previously reported, sources in the company speculate that Pittman will not return to his duties as COO once he completes his stint at AOL.

In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX.


 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.
Why do you say Dell is cheaper than DNUK?
It gets a bit complicated though!

AOL KEYWORD: FRAUD PROBE
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Another three bite the dust. Three former executives from real
estate dot-com Homestore have agreed to plead guilty to criminal 
charges and repay $4.6 million in stock gains. What's more
interesting is that they'll cooperate with an investigation into 
AOL's role in the dubious dealing. This is the most real estate
drama you'll get this week without renting ""Glengarry Glen
Ross.""
Homestore's former COO was charged with wire fraud and
conspiracy to commit securities fraud (up to 10 years in jail),
the former CFO with just the conspiracy charge (up to five
years), and an ex-VP with insider trading (less time, but
unknown). The big accusation here is ""round tripping,"" in which
Homestore would buy goods from a company as long as the company
then spent most of the money on AOL ads. Then AOL would
supposedly spend the same amount of money at Homestore, ""thus
allowing Homestore effectively to 'buy' revenue using its own
cash,"" explained the Wall Street Journal.
Homestore has become a cause celebre for Attorney General John
Ashcroft, who held a press conference to emphasize that the Bush 
administration really means it about this corporate clean-up
thing. Neither Ashcroft, the Justice Department, nor the SEC
named names, referring only to Homestore's relationship with ""a
major media company."" Nice try for anonymity, but AOL Time
Warner was the only major media company Homestore dealt with,
observed the New York Times. Now the heat's on AOL while
investigators try and figure out how much of AOL's revenue was
inflated like a Thanksgiving Day Parade float.
 
The L.A. Times' sources said AOL execs pointed the finger at
former company dealmaker Eric Keller. The Journal led with, and
expanded on, this info. It seems two of the three busted
Homestore execs are expected to say Keller helped Homestore do
its round-tripping, and that some AOL ad revenue that looked
legit on paper really came from Homestore. Keller has already
been pink-slipped for shady deals with Homestore and another
company; his boss got booted last month for possible
book-cooking. 
So where's the perp walk? The umbrella stand? The theatrics that 
make the corporate crime beat great? We're kidding (mostly), but 
that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this
comparatively tame example of American excess. The Journal had
one amusing tidbit, though: After Keller got fired, AOL vice
chairman Ted Leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey
team the Washington Capitals, of which Leonsis is the majority
owner. Leonsis said he let Keller go after finding out why he
lost his AOL job, but Keller still picked up his Capitals phone
as of Wednesday. As outrageous severance packages go, it's no

VIVENDI MEETS THE NEW BOSS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What does Vivendi want to be when it grows up? The media can't
figure it out. Can CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou? His fuzziness at
yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. If he
can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 20/20
clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? For
Fourtou, worse than the Monsieur Magoo accusations are the
comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he
resembles -- wait, we're rubbing our eyes -- the vilified
Jean-Marie Messier.
Media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over Fourtou's
latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets
devoted to their coverage of the mess. The New York Times ran 24 
paragraphs on the board meeting -- and then filed another 19 in
an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant.  
The Financial Times posted two articles on the meeting and still 
had more to say, lambasting Fourtou in Lex, the peach paper's
influential column. Lex called the exec's update ""more like a
rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation.""
There's little that's clear about what's ahead for Vivendi. The
company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth
of assets over the next 18 months. Here's how reporters
examining the tea leaves read the current plan: Out are Telepiu, 
an Italian pay-TV operation, and Canal Plus Technologies, a
maker of set-top boxes. On the way out are Vivendi's publishing
properties, which include Houghton Mifflin, and a minority stake 
in a PC gamemaker. That leaves Vivendi's stake in telecom, via
its Cegetel investment, and its Universal entertainment
properties, and -- hey, wait a minute, wasn't that Messier's
plan, the New York Times wondered by way of an analyst's quote.
To confuse matters further, News Corp., the alleged partner in
the done deal for Telepiu, says no deal is in place, according
to the Financial Times. As for Cegetel, Fourtou said he'd
consider selling Vivendi's 44% stake; then again, maybe he'll
increase it. And that was all in one post-meeting telephone
conference. 
The only decision by Vivendi in which Fourtou seemed sure was
his claim that the company won't pay any severance to Messier.
""He enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the Guardian
quoted Fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""This all went to his 
head."" 
With heads other than Messier's now in question, is Vivendi's
viability again in doubt? Outlets today report that Enron's
logo, the oversize capital ""E"" that stood outside its
headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. How many euros might
a V bring? - Deborah Asbrand

 Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims. 
 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
 front of the bank's name.

 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online."" 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 
 Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology,"" said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me,
it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.
If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with
the Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been
reported.  Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a
different IP.  As long as no one can establish my connection to the
web sites my spam is directing people to, I'm home free.
Here is the bug I opened:
  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762
RBLs have the same problem, but there is no negative RBL header rule
with a -20 score that can be forged, so the problem is unique to Habeas.
Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I
gain by making it easier for spam to get through??
My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was
not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after
the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance,
etc.
There's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People
who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
email that doesn't look like spam (I'm not counting spam mailing lists
which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).

I was thinking of just removing those particular rules, but keeping the
other entries in the range, since they're proving too ""noisy"" to be
effective.  But I'd be willing to keep those ones in, all the same.  What
do you think?  Matt/Craig, thoughts?
I think I could handle commenting out the lowest SPAM_PHRASE_XX_YY
scores.  If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they'd
automatically be zeroed, I'd feel better since the ranges could change
next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.
I think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before
we remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.
And here are the rules that seem like they should be better or should
be recoverable:
  FROM_MISSING
  GAPPY_TEXT
  INVALID_MSGID
  MIME_NULL_BLOCK
  SUBJ_MISSING
well, I don't like SUBJ_MISSING, I reckon there's a world of mails from
cron jobs (e.g.) which hit it.
Okay, drop SUBJ_MISSING.
But, yes, the others for sure should be recoverable, and I'm sure there's
more.
Probably a few, those seemed like the best prospects to me.
BTW do you agree with the proposed methodology (ie. remove the rules and
bugzilla each one?)
I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with
quick WONTFIX closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery.
If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should
be automatable with email at the very least), it would help.

Last week,
Axialis Software
released IconWorkshop v5.0 - arguably the most powerful icon
editor / manager for the Windows platform. Ever the icon addict, I
asked for your pixel-perfect creations. I have yet to receive one.
Perhaps you've been waiting for the right motivation? How about a
nice little contest involving some of the most powerful sites on
the Internet? Here's the deal: you create five (or more) icons
between now and the end of July 2002, upload them to your [FREE]
DeviantArt account (under Contests / Axialis Icon Contest), and
one of the five judges may pick it. The panel includes: myself,
MattEO from
DeviantArt
,
KarmaGirl from
WinCustomize
, Voodoo from
Neowin
, and Marc from
Axialis. We'll each pick our favorite set. The winners will not
only receive one copy of IconWorkshop Corporate Edition, but some
of their icons will get bundled with a future version of the
software! Ownership is retained by the original author, so don't
hold back. Here's your chance at fame and fortune. Or, at least
fame and free software.
Ah, the life of a software junkie! Pieter just released the new
(unofficial)
Google SearchTool
today. It's much more convenient than the official toolbar (sorry,
I just don't like browser add-ons). I also gave
Cacheman
another go; I haven't used it since Windows 98. It's always been a
great piece of shareware, but I didn't realize it was THIS good.
The speed increase has been quite noticeable (even on Storm Shadow,
my P4 2.5GHz machine). Outer Technologies is brilliant. And so is
Repligator 9.0
. It gives
me access to instant special effects - a one-stop shop for digital
photo fun. I'm still debating whether or not to install the latest
Java runtimes. It seems to be unobtrusive on my test machine,
which is good to see; I don't want browser integration, I just
wanna run that awesome ASCII Art program. Oh, and ""12 Mistakes
Executives Make When Planning Web Strategy"" is available for FREE
with the purchase of ANY
GnomeTome
(including our 50
freshly-released OS X tips). Go grab it if your boss doesn't know
as much as s/he should.
There's a little bit of Oingo Boingo on
Emusic
now. They inked a
deal with Universal Music Group today - and I'm not paying any
more to get access to even
more MP3s
. This is the ONLY
way to go, and I hope and pray that more record labels will
eventually catch on to the craze. The Internet is more than a
place for a pseudo-interactive pamphlet; the Internet fosters
knowledge; the Internet is still in its infancy; the Internet has
encouraged creativity and commerce. The one thing the Internet is
NOT: a fad. Its potential is limitless, as long as it remains
flexible and not controlled by any one company. This
Palladium
thing has got me more than a little spooked. It, combined with the
service-oriented OS, could very well be the thing that drives
people away from the Windows platform in droves (as much as I hate
to admit it). Software and music pirates unwittingly created DRM.
I best not find out that you're part of the problem.

was just looking at this new application. It shows a graphical
representation of every planet in our solar system (as opposed to
every planet in the Hoth system) and its moons. It also provides
detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun,
its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to Earth. What I found
most interesting was how long a single ""day"" lasts on different

Earth? I guess he chased Chip and Dale around the Christmas tree

Pop-Up Menu Navigation Software
Scribbled by Pat Wong
http://popup.jscentral.com/
I found some really cool software to generate Web site navigation
menus, and I thought you might be interested in learning about it.
There are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my
own. Here's a small write-up about it; perhaps you'd be interested
in running this in a future Lockergnome issue? We've all seen a
lot of really cool site navigation menus, with pop-up text, neat
mouseover effects, and the like. Most of them require a
combination of HTML and JavaScript to build, which is expertise
that goes way beyond some of us. At last, it's possible to easily
generate just such a menu with some very user-friendly screens to
enter the data you want to use.
Pop-Up Menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully
licensed version ($34.95 for a Home User license / $129.95 for the
Web Designer license). The biggest difference? With the licensed
version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so
you can modify it later. Your only alternative, if you want to
make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware
version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving
into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). Be
forewarned: The JavaScript reads like a novel, so modifying that
could potentially be a nightmare. I decided to buy the fully
licensed version and I'm really glad I did. Sorry if I sound like
a commercial for the company; I don't work for them or stand to be
compensated in any way for recommending them. I just think this
menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while.

Who knows how to thwart false charges? Lockergnomie Steve
Lafferty: ""In a recent article over the PayPal issue, it was
stated that when using a credit card illegally, the owner of that
card is responsible for the first $50.  However, sometging that
very few people know about is that there is a US Federal provision
in the banking industry called 'Reg E' (Regulation E / Electronic
Funds Transfer). This stipulates that all transactions will err in
favor of the customer (account holder). This means that if your
'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not
responsible for any of the charges. My suggestion is never to use
a credit card - and only use your bank debit card. That way, if
someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the
charges."" For more information, please refer to Section 205 on
FEDERALRESERVE.GOV. Obviously, this tip only applies to people
living in the USA. If you haven't been watching your statements
like a hawk lately, you'd be wise to start soon. Identity theft is
a growing concern. When my wallet was stolen, I found
IDENTITYTHEFT.ORG to be a godsend.

ham,"I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To
me, it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.
You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:
1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.
2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.
I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:
OVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME
  13851     8919     4932    0.64    0.00  (all messages)
      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWE
The score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a
useless rule so far.

This week, we present a special shopper report featuring
four cool products. We have reviewed these products,
compared each to five products with similar features,
and analyzed the range of prices for each category. What
you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the ""Price-Feature
Ratio Analysis."" Featured products can fall in to three
stages of Price-Feature ratios:
Stage 1: High Price-Feature Ratio - Technophiles will rush
to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices
for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one.
Stage 2: Variable Price-Feature Ratio - Expect high variability
in prices among products with similar features. It pays to
comparison shop for the best price.
Stage 3: Low Price-Feature Ratio - When compared to products
with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much
from merchant to merchant. Use our merchant ratings to
find the right one for you.
We have rated each of the products featured in this supplement
to aid your shopping experience.

Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in
""How to Collect MoneyJudgments""
If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and
why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income
.
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between
200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollectedMoney
Judgment debt
. For every Judgment that is paid, 5more
Judgments take its place.
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.
With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.
The income potential is substantial in this profession.
We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year
.
Some choose to operateout of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.
Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time .
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
Quote's from several of our students:
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.
My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
.Your
professionalism in both the manual and your support.
You have the video opened doors for me in the future.
There's no stopping me now. Recently Thomas states
he has over $8,500,000 worth of judgments he is working on""
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us:
""I am now making $2,000.00 per
week
and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now""
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""I am now making $12,000.00 per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months""
From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:
With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
Please call us at 1-2`8`1-5`0`0-4`0`1`8
.
We have Service Support
staff available to you from 8:00am to
10:00pm (Central Time) 7 days a week
. If you callthis number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.
Thank you for your time and interest.

Dear Readers,
With all the corporate scandals--such as WorldCom and Enron--surrounding us, who can you trust nowadays? Well, for starters, you can trust the CNET Message Boards. The
CNET Message Boards
are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question 
in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

Why I don't use firewalls
Do you need some honest opinions? Despite all the horror stories that you hear of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open.

The scoop on USB 2.0
The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

Why not start with mass-check corpus results? It's much easier to get
those
Ah. As in getting a directory listing of the corpus server and doing some

and you can create your own tmp/scores.h and tmp/tests.h.

Eddie Kessler describes programming at Napster[1]. 
Ray Ozzie has more on platforms[2]. ""Finding the 'right' price point for a 
software platform is critical."" To me this sounds like a fancy way of saying, 
""I groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous, 
but I can't bring myself to do it."" The price, Ray says, ""must be high enough 
both 1) to maintain a perception of value in the platform, and 2) to create 
significant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is 
assured of the platform's ultimate viability."" What he doesn't mention: if you 
lower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, 
which will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have 
to close. But that must be what he's thinking.

Folks who've been hacking on the DNSBLs: would it be worthwhile commenting
this in HEAD, seeing as it only gets .77 anyway?

Sounds like the (a) broken server and (b) low hitrate combine to make it
not-so-useful IMO.
No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use,
which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
services better.
The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.
Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

Brent confessed recently that he had tried to subvert the X
model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)

I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.

My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.

nice thing about a statistical inferencer is that you really don't have to

Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. 
Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) 
Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. 
Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. 
But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.

Subject: [SAtalk] Getting yourself removed from spam lists
I get the feeling that the spammers never
remove emails from their lists.
Correct...
On the other hand, that doesn't make sense:
wouldn't they get worried about their millions
of spams being wasted?  Don't they WANT *some*
prove that they indeed *reach* people somehow?
No, they only have to prove that they send several million
emails to 'potential clients' to get their money.  I don't think
they even care much about bounces.  They're con-artists, why
should they care about proving they actually reached people?
So... it seems to me that they DO clean up
their lists, but only when a spam fails to
deliver - or can't they detect that?
Most of the time the bounce goes to some poor soul who has
nothing to do with the spammer.
What do spammers do with email addresses in
their database that are undeliverable for a
few years?  Do they still continue to spam
them?
Yes.

ham,"First, it was my understanding that they had the food before they
refused to pay.  I often have the goods in my possession before I settle

Second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in
India.  It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so
I'll have to watch them starve.  The margin of survival is very, very,
thin.
So yes.  In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a
little food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to
cause suffering if not death on the victims family.  That such an act
triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.
In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the
first shot.
With all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not.  Nor
do I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors
was that thin.

Wow!  It seems you are evaluating this with a large reality distortion
field.

If the activists on the train refused to pay for food, then the
vendors
shouldn't give it to them.  And the local police force should be
arresting them.  Etc.

You have to be operating from a particularly primitive point of view,
which obviously was in operation with the participants here, to think
that religious differences or not being paid for a little food (or
taunting!) was even a remote justification for burning a train full of
people alive.

June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or
placed by you or under your control:
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has
condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the
DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for
Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an
alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France-
Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to
countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by
representatives of either nation.""
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early
1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall
Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled
the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has
disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of
2/1/00)
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of
false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom
of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a
serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how
distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of
my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am
obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully
offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your
text will be set off (with ""**"") in color:
**DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti.**
(Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall
Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in
which case a reader may be misled.)
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern
Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific.
**However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent
assertions"" of two organizations, ...**
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the
'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true?
Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been
internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud,
abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every
financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to
serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for
the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign
invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their
own corrupt government?)
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the
Marshallese name for Wake Island),...**
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for
DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister
nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is
not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a
deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the
sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and
irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources
anymore?)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and
the same could be said for DOM.
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged
investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.**
(Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people
of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands
and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for
perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse""
has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands
government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not
now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have
tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources
for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also
will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are
currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have
in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate
entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists
use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't
anybody check sources anymore?)
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries
against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of
either nation.**
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of
which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published
information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against
acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of...""
nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that
effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any
RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the
credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral
sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the
Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his
will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will
happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of
lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and
they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their
jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.)
**A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the
early 1990s.**
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu
in the early 1990s.)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and
6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount
Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and
was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign
state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King
over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established
government as a limited constitutional monarchy.
**It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands
paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf.**
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted
brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the
post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a
Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific
instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from
Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the
people's behalf.
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and
ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.**
(Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The
Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special
Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of
EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no
political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of
Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not
incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was
it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of
any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any
statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.)
Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more
research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion
of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before
arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you
to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents
mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace')
and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site.
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected
elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above
in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the
author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio'
correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request
for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author
regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio.
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet
can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December
10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation
once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According
to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was
leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of
EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims
the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands.""
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article
of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00)
Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press
release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under
a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an
act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal
authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall
Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to
publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a
suitable land base for its people to administer their form of
government.
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day
of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a
state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our
governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had
nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert
Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not
convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence.
This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of
landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to
Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount
Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction.
Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by
Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios.
Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter
case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of
Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr.
Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998,
the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of
the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll
(a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names).
For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in-
cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a
completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign
of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive
intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your
journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be
proved accurate.
I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment
and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric
history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named
by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and
missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the
public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and
most of which are referenced or published at our official web address:
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be
added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from
one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00).
""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the
Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a
U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for
recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and
pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.
The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests
took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the
illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of
the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of
an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's
independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after
the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as
Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American
businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls,
which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.""
Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward
facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet
since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced
text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very
serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke,
which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your
summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios
and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line
by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off
(with ""**"") in color:
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall
Islands of the western Pacific.**
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western
explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in
Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean.
The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the
role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory.""
**After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional
chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part
of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll,
called Enenkio locally.**
Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific,
which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of
the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well
established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and,
having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese
invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak
atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands
of Eneen-Kio Atoll.
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions
here.""
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.**
Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the
Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its
move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional
landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios.
The Author responds: ""I will note this.""
**The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993
acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment
by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.**
Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after
precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged
the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of
Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the
following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People.
**King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the
northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.**
Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death
in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994,
whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited
constitutional monarchy.
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here.""
**The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained
its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary
in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore
land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared
the Dominion of Melchizedek.**
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his
brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today.
To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have
nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since
HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak
atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10
atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story,
which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have
offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct
your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our
pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and
interest in this matter.
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's
Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources
& Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I
will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response,
Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the
next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background:
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the
Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0
(discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar,
Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His
Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or
state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the
said ""press release"" is indeed an official document.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that
representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King
Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right
and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons,
many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall
Islands.
Response to so-called ""Press Release"":
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also
unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an
unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon
Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the
U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report)
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall
Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio:
Â» Â» exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo
Convention (1933).
Â» Â» was conceived as a separate independent state by its
sovereign,
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987.
Â» Â» was established by way of a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.
Â» Â» has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many
other
states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek
Â» Â» has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over
islands
and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries.""
Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional
and
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred
heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI
Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak
atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
Â» Â» has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its
political
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and
seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of
Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the
Marshall Islands.
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall
Islands:
Â» Â» also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the
Montevideo
Convention (1933).
Â» Â» was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign
governments,
which included the United States, China and the USSR.
Â» Â» was also established under a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people.
Â» Â» has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of
anything that is not also public information and no such public
information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has
ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar.
Â» Â» has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the
islands
and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in
1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any
present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to
the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter.
Â» Â» exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution,
which
does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over
territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio
Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant
matter.
Â» Â» has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom
of
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the
suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of
Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to
coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap
Hermios.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements
or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility,
existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in
the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication
by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as
deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His
Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of
EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate
responsive measures.
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom
of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following
statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands,
then you decide for yourself:
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace
and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the
aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and
striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal.""
On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom
of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a
free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background:
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on
reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics
and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC,
February 1999, states as follows:
""Where Are OFCs Located?
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction
anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest
OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote
areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere
figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek
(sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in
intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center]
Response:
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble
citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible
categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an
unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His
Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs
thereof.
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt
to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics
trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels,
terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without
even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate
such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United
States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the
United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the
United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of
power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United
States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional
representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised
of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in
kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of
Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic
cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

March 16, 1999: News Release
The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios,
First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern
Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was
felt throughout the society.Â  Flags were flown at half mast for a
week
in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the
world.Â  His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the
highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom.
Â 
His Majesty King Remios Hermios
Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio
He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will
formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head
of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.Â 
His
Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and
maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be
his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios.

March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration
The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of
interests exists between it and the United States Government.Â  The
United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism,
appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in
""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State,
which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.Â  The
explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by
agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments
of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many
Marshallese.Â  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and
outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not
healed.
Thus a current state of adversity exists.Â  Following four years of
attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the
Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to
Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese
King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the
world.Â  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept
as
virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue
of being kept out.Â  It was through this pragmatic initiative that
the
Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon
the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the
ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios.
In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.Â 
While a
state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past
wrongs remains on the horizon.Â  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not
condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or
agent of any government.Â  Such unnecessary means would diminish any
hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the
cause of peace within the family of nations.Â  The Kingdom of
EnenKio
also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of
the Marshallese people.
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the
U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter,
conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination,
preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses,
it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the
people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.Â  The refusal
of
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple
discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with
representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity,
turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of
the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute
the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.Â  Your
understanding is appreciated.Â

December 19, 1998: News Release
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the
occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio,
His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts
are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999.
Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made
his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of
traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a
family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved.
Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as
Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and
High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as
our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to
be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a
successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be
announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head
of State.
HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as
Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the
Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first
discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a
well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by
force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western
ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and
beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally
occupied by the federal government of the United States.
In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios
clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in
interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio
Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the
Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of
the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official
Internet site.
On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely
grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and
are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be
recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people
by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese
domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has
passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese
ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the
mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best
wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to
all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: CommuniquÃ© to Correspondents
Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have
been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands
government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more
admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for
disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased
report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding
the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are
cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or
concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the
State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply:
The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No
claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any
claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in
the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the
ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of
war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as
an honorable state among nations.
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting
authority over land ...within the geographical and political
boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed
imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of
Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish
there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one
has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue
be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous
weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our
shirtsleeves, our raison d'Ãªtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble
to
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site:
http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled
""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was
advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver
licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of
EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary,
our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so
steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are
advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such
an act is patently illegal.
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap
Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I
have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and
ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the
statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its
territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to
their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by
Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney.""
HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the
northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of
his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens
who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and
peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic]
(actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is
the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300
miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker
applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society
writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning
of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the
First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first
pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the
Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997.
First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First
Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time
following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are
encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint
mailing list.
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the
government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution
in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the
island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of
the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended
recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship
are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA
and elsewhere.
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake
Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned
names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people
in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the
atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant
jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and
cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the
government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial
title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at
the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar
fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful
return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by
Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the
Monarchy.
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to
top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a
virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the
blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from
United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to
request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related
factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific
Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the
atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom
have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal
advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events
and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the
world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights
violations by federal agents of the United States government.
INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and
dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium
nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the
basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets
varies according to the value and stability of national currency units,
the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with
any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the
stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be
determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are
printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended
for use as money.
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people
from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of
EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In
doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the
federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with
human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from
the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom
and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top
Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the
United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts
that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF
ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most
recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One
of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a
Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding
the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United
States.
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of
disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the
government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with
similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the
premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and
compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal
action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal
government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal
announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and
failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world
regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by
the United States.
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three
small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for
Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue
is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land
tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal
chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United
States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in
1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple
landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war
missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of
the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a
cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the
East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was
destined to become a military installation.
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President
by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of
correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without
establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the
first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood
from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that
jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not
establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA
(predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base
for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called
annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently
illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.
When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally
significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent
was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake
Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak
chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of
Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall
group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was,
the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at
Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby
activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or
quintessential knowledge by the American public.
Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian
Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there
being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel
Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in
sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder
of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title.
The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from
aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its
Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures
the rights of ownership.
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the
administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration,
""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island
nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or
unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom,
over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that
truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of
power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the
record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are
all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it
comes to seizure of land and denial of rights.
In the Declaration, demands are made as follows:
Â» Â» ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an
honorable
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."".
Â» Â» ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to
submit to
Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR
reparations to citizens.""
Â» Â» ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone...""
Â» Â» ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in
commerce by failure the Department of the Interior
Â» Â» ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more
than
TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a
Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is
obligated to pay.""
Â» Â» That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to
immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating
the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights
and due process..."".
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable
nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the
Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a
peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of
the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly.
Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll,
titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern
atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall
Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe!
The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you
to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to
take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take
appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as
you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy
insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the
federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your
anonymity and that of your publication is well served.
Summary of Events 1993-94:
Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment
of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as
Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two
announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii
said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu
newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island
airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another
military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994;
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama
issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch
program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to
believe.
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was
held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under
the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of
independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as
king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the
first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake
I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant
impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature
into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its
sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership
claims.
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the
nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His
Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr.
Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution,
Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted.
On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into
law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the
USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the
people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent
peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as
owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and
embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of
democratic government.
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world
proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were
presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation
requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United
Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others.
Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request
for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council.
On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent
via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding
the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the
islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued
disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms
of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall
Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged
receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now
in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million.
The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994,
relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent,
only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands
Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then
only briefly.
Request for Media Response:
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural
calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and
deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a
new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an
aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth
of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about
suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the
security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of
""world leadership""? Or is it world domination?
People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an
effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby,
hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of
their ancestral heritage:
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed
invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper
annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized
by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for
at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and
validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a
fabrication.)
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of
specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack
thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my
understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing""
of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war,
technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds
against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop
serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the
king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the
citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their
government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and
fiscal manner.
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of
questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation,
offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research,
environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note:
Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island
and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets
and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less
publicized projects.)
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with
regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by
King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored
and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human
rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and
conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal
to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military
and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology
for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year
and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious
significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio
citizens.)
Parting Shot:
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in
general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow
behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the
right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest
inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an
approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner
of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright
alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent
trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports,
forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and
virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have
escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government.
Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable
thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry
of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a
century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only
be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of
American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and
inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States
by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures
and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from
matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in
determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to
know; the media a responsibility to show them.
In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is
one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political
philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives
for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human
cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual
rights.
Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and
forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands
which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty,
King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister
Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of
Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials
in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing
came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the
illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by
the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899.
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value
and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common
Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King
Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S.
claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human
rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also
establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to
answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand
valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was
made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land.
Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per
month through 1995.
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S.
officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which
keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory
exile.
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a
small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands,
including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal
chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for
religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC.
During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and
explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the
real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the
islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who
recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill
Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy.
King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief
(Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the
Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll.
Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the
islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of
restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most
recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air
Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii.
Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu
Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air
Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much
activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"".
According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private
entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a
stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral
heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people.
Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation
under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate
and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to
direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as
a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive
Council.
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the
effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any
substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers
and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the
recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the
lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios:
Â» Â» Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al
Gore
in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in
their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were
ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more
than a decade ago.
Â» Â» In response to the Environmental Assessment of the
proposed
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of
protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated
launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into
the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered.
Â» Â» Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket
launch
activities and requesting help went unanswered.
Â» Â» A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which
declared the
status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the
administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise
ignored.
After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the
declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United
States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council.
They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied
access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of
Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the
Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government
recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his
family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio .
While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of
foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included
agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of
Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the
past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the
future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace.
Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the
United States.
Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S.
Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President
Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall
Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges
superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of
ownership and use of land.
Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military
might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations
(e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other
Ministers and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully
displace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His
Majesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document
was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up
in International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
In an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the
restoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international
recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the
Sovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent
documents of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations
Security Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations
and to the governments of most other nations of the world.
It is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment
of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and
relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time,
Mr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to
inform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or
by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is
made to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of
EnenKio.

 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
 Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing
Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE® software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
of 
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.
Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
Technology, Inc. today
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
e-security.® This strategic
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. 
Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.
Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.
""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing""
Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured® Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID® two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrust® Web access
management, RSA BSAFE® encryption and RSA Keon® digital certificate management.
The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.
""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""
About Magi
Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure
inter- and intra-enterprise
collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for
collaboration very rapidly and
affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this
by effectively transforming
unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
the use of such features as
cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
spaces generating ""follow me URLs""
for mobile professionals.

Listen.  If you pull numbers like that without a fact, the automagic
assumption is yes, they were extracted out of your neither orifice.
Point wasn't to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits.
Its not my job to do _your_ bit searching for you, but I figured I'd
humor fork with this bit of finding:

http://www.thebody.com/bp/apr01/research_notebook.html  (Pointing ot
averages of about 13 for every 3 months (for gay men), which totals to
about  52 a year.  52 a year doesn't equal 3000.   Or even 300.
Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's
estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 
52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average
age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some 
participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. 
At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to
think that some the participants may have actually slowed 
their pace a bit. 
So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could 
easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study
will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active 
sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution
could easily be in the 3000+ range.
Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall 
population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence
of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest 
that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so
people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it
were sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise.

Ben Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link 
between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. 
    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates. 
    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used. 
    Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing. 
    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts...

Five Music Concerns To Pay $143.1 Million In Price-Fixing Case

million in cash to compensate consumers who overpaid for CDs between
1995 and 2000. The companies also agreed to distribute $75.7 million

We did a great panel on DRM and the Digital Hub yesterday here at OSXCon with 
Tim O'Reilly, Victor Nemachek (from El Gato, makers of the EyeTV digital TV 
recorder for the Mac), Dan Gillmor, and JD Lasica, who's working on a book on 
fair use and copyfights. Glenn ""802.11b Networking News"" Fleishman took great 
notes through the talk: 
    Dan: Tim, you're a ""content or copyright holdertalk about these issues."" 
    Obscurity can be a tool. Something like 100K books published in the US. 
    Most books are forgotten after publication. Ravening copying theft is 
    wrong: most aren't pirated. Publishers puts book that someone sweated over 
    for years on shelves for three months, doesn't sell, that's it, and the 
    author has no rights. Publishers keeps rights til out of print, etc. 
    Oblivion is fate of most books: ""Piracy would be the best thing for those 
    books."" People wouldn't pirate them in general, because people generally 
    like to respect the rights of creators. ""Piracy is a marginal act; it takes 
    away some of the cream."" 
    Publishing won't go away, but it will change the idea of who is a 
    publisher. Early on in the Web, the idea was that everyone could be a 
    publisher. The way in which Web sites interact with publishers is often 
    very much like the way that book publishers try to get placement and 
    position in bookstores. 
    Publishing is aggregation. People will re-emerge as publishers. Will 
    Hollywood be the publishers of the future or will someone else? 
    Users are voting by their use of programs like Kazaa. Eventually, media 
    companies will adopt. But if the changes are hardcoded into law, then we're 
    stuck for a long time with ""some mistakes.""

Brooklyn Bridge for sale! No kidding! The town of Brooklyn, 
Iowa has a bridge that they are
selling on Ebay

a structure, or just want to have the right to say you 
legitimately purchased the Brooklyn Bridge, here's your 
opportunity! Seriously, this is not a prank!
Ever since I was down toward Des Moines last week and had 
a cup-o-java with Jake at Starbucks, I've been craving 
coffee. I can't see myself turning into a coffee junkie like 
Chris, but it's just weird that this would happen, being 
that my extent of coffee drinking has usually been limited 
to the severe need for a quick morning wake-up or in an 
effort to keep warm on cold mornings when out in the field 
back in my Marine Corps days.
As time has gone on, I've been trying to cut back on the 
typical geek vices of sugar and caffeine, but I can't drink 
coffee straight. It has to be sweet, and what's the point of 
drinking coffee if there's no caffeine? Enter Splenda. An 
artificial sweetener that has finally made it to Waterloo, 
Iowa. Most of what Diana and I use sugar for has been 
modified to use Splenda instead, with good results. 
Hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it 
usually is. I have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from 
the nasty breath. It's fun to test out the dragon-breath on 
the cat to see just how bad it really is. If Bootes sniffs a 
couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly 
recoils, time to employ the Sonicare for a couple of 
minutes. See what you've started, Jake?
See You in

Exchange Titanium Details Emerge
http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2002/jul02/07-15exchangeqa.asp
Oracle recently announced their intention to compete 
directly with Microsoft Exchange, even accepting Outlook as 
an email client. In what seems like a direct response, we're 
handed details of the 2003 release of Exchange Titanium. 
I've always liked what Exchange can do, so I'm certainly 
looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all 
about, but I'm also interested in what Oracle will be 
bringing to the table. Better email functionality, control 
and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being 
the vendor of choice. Included in this Q&A is a screenshot 
of what Outlook may look like once Office 11 is released. 
It's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they 
plan to handle email views. It doesn't say anything for 
Exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless.

Better Pocket PC Audio
Unearthed by David Spencer
http://home.adelphia.net/~mdukette/downloads.html
An open source project is bringing a different spin to 
audio and video on Pocket PCs, and my first impression is... 
cool! I like what they're working on here. I decided to wipe 
out my Jornada yesterday, so I haven't done a direct 
comparison between the iPaq 3870 and Jornada 565 for audio 
quality using this player, which has an equalizer built-in, 
but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds 
on the iPaq right out of the gate. Definitely give this a 
peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and 
video on a Pocket PC. Quite a few different versions are 
supported, so you should be able to find something 
appropriate to your device.

Where's Java?
http://news.com.com/2100-1001-944053.html
Three readers asked me about this very thing this week, 
and it's something you should probably know about if you use 
Windows XP. Microsoft didn't bundle the Java Virtual Machine 
with Windows XP, and since the release of XP, the JVM has been avaialble via the 
Windows Update site as a ""convenience"" to users. Part of Sun's legal
complaints surrounding how Microsoft has handled Java was that Microsoft did not have the right to 
distribute their implementation via the web, though 
they did have licensing rights to include it with Windows. 
So essentially, Microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. 
Well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, Microsoft 
has yanked the JVM from the Windows Update site and all 
other areas of Microsoft's web site. Microsoft is still 
planning to include Java with Windows XP Service Pack 1. 
You'll have to plan for Java support accordingly, as SP1 is 
still a ways off and you can't get it from Microsoft at this 
point. If you need it for a new installation of Windows XP 
in the short term, Sun will gladly provide you with
their 
own distibution

Another Xeon Deal
Served up by Warren Dugas
http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?sku=C170-1032%20P
I mentioned a really nice deal on Compaq Evo W6000 dual-
Xeon workstations a few weeks back, which I know several of 
you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared 
off many others. If you still want to get into a Xeon, check 
this one out. TigerDirect is offering an Evo W8000 
workstation with a single 1.7GHz processor, 18.2GB 15,000rpm U160 
drive, 48x CD-ROM and licenses for both Windows 2000 Pro and 
NT 4.0 Workstation for $699.99. Note that there is NO memory 
and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for 
yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. 
Also realize that these systems take RAMBUS memory, which 
will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're 
getting - a wicked-fast workstation, to be sure! Expandability is also quite amazing with these machines.
Recommend It!

ham,"Hi,
some time now the following messages were haunting me:
     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude
It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.
# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...
I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Don't worry about the warnings. To fix the error, edit spamc.c and right
   Thanks for posting this tip - I had the same problem compiling with
Tru64 and that took care of it.
   When I did the ""make install"" I got this error:
LOCK:  -f /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
 || cp rules/local.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
sh: syntax error at line 1: `||' unexpected
*** Exit 2
Stop.
   It appears that this comes from the ""inst_cfs:"" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?

Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of
today?s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by
centralization.

Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one
answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate
agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific
context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid
value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A)
according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more
slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the
basis for today?s most popular architectural style for developing
network applications: client-server interaction using request-response
communication protocols.
I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database
is key to decentralization. 
Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.
Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
  by have some play with time and value
Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
  called congnitive dissonance theory
Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.
I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
The local information when combined with the technical
troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization
to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
concerns are more immedidate.  
Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,
including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently
be in its proper place.

Cool, one less package to maintain :)

One interesting thing about alsaplayer is that RedHat's XMMS package in RH8 will
probably not play mp3 files. But alsaplayer does play mp3s ""out of the box"".

Also, they are developing rapidly in their CVS and looks like their next version
of alsaplaer will be pretty cool, but I have no idea when it will be ready.

Curious.  I changed the arguments to Ftoc_ShowSequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  Somehow your version 
of ScanFolder is still trying to pass $F.  You seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).

I don't know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely 
up to date.
Actually, I take that back.  You're not running the latest ftoc.tcl either.
It probably is my bug, but it's in code that's been changed since you last 
updated from CVS (Saturday), so please update and let's see if the problem is 
still there.

Good to hear it's not just me.  Mind telling me how you set PERL5LIB
specificly? I've tried a few things (setenv in the shell, as well as
$PERL5LIB == ...inside the Makefile.PL, even on the perl command
line..) with no success.

- Presuming your run Bash  :
Note the directory lists 
#  perl -e 'map { print ""$_\n"" } @INC'
Then set up the Shell variable PERL5LIB variable (and put it in some .bashrc 
for future use)
# export PERL5LIB=""directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4""
Then try to install the software
PERL5LIB is explained perlrun(1) : do 
# man perlrun for more information

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.
The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.
According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.
""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.
In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.
""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.
The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.
DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.
========================================================================
DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.
DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.
DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.
""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.
""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""
""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences
file 
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This

happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in
Ftoc_ShowSequences.
That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my
abstraction to 
have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what 
messages are in this sequence?"".  One option would have been to add
another 
call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the
check-the-modify-time 
technique would be less error-prone.
I like the check-the-modify-time technique.
I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to
allow 
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that
the 
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all
sequences 
for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message
yesterday.

And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.
OK - I've yet to dive into the latest round of changes, but I plan to.
I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.

Both problems you reported (libasound.so and wrong xine dependency) are now

           Summary: Split up FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement

         Component: Rules
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com
The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.
Here is what I got:

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

Is it safe to conclude that avoiding any cleverness with headers is a
good thing?
Since I don't know what you did, exactly, I can't guess.  What you seemed to
show is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so
helped (the ""after"" numbers are better than the ""before"" numbers, right?).
Assuming that what you did was override what's now
tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn't
call the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missing
carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many
dozens of other header fields.  There's no question that adding more header
fields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only
because my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without
getting major benefits for bogus reasons.
Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By several
accounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm
(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the
reason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer
reported good results from this scheme:
    ip_re = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})')
    for header in msg.get_all(""received"", ()):
        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):
            parts = ip.split(""."")
            for n in range(1, 5):
                yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n])
This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled

ham,"Guido> Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The
    Guido> Perl Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?
Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).
Basic procmail usage goes something like this:
    :0fw
    | spamassassin -P
    :0
    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
    $SPAM
Which just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins
""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.
SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

elimination and such), so that will likely fall, but -15 might 
not be enough of a correction in many situations.  I will set 
the scores for the Habeas stuff and the Ironport stuff to be 
sensible given:

a) estimated likeliness of compliance with Habeas/Bonded sender 
rules, and
b) score correction level needed to achieve purposes of those projects.
Using the score-ranges stuff and my aggressive anti-FP evaluation code,
BTW, yielded an average FP of 5.7 points, with 0.67% FPs and 96.57%
overall accuracy -- but I notice you went back to the other method.
Just pointing this out ;)

I had GPG working.
I updated from version gnupg-1.0.6 to gnupg-1.0.7.
This moved gpg from /usr/bin to /usr/local/bin and I changed the path
in the exmh 'executable'.
With that fix, EXMH knows I have GPG, and puts the line
	Check the signature with GnuPG
in messages with GnuPG signatures.  But punching the line ALWAYS
gives
        Signature made Thu Aug 29 00:27:17 2002 MDT using DSA key ID BDDF997A
        Can't check signature: public key not found
So, something else is missing.
Can somebody tell me what it is,- Ive tried grepping on everything

DEAR SIR, 
  
I AM MR. 
Thema Ordi, MANAGER OF BILLS/EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE 
DEPARTMENT OF ABSA BANK LIMITED. IN MY DEPARTMENT, WE DISCOVERED AN 
ABANDONED SUM OF US$12.5,000,000 (Twelve POINT FIVE MILLION US 
DOLLARS ONLY) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO 
DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE 
CRASH. SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 
HIS NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT 
RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT-OF-KIN, OR RELATION TO 
THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, 
NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS MONEY. 
  
IT IS BASED ON THIS THAT SOME OFFICIALS IN MY DEPARTEMENT AND I HAVE 
DECIDED TO ESTABLISH A CORDIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, HENCE 
MY CONTACTING YOU. WE WANT YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS THE NEXT-OF-KIN 
OR RELATION OF THE DECEASED SO THAT THE FUND CAN BE REMITTED INTO YOUR

ANY ACCOUNT ABANDONED OR IS DORMANT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS IS DEEMED 
CLOSED AND ALL MONEY CONTAINED THEREIN FORFEITED TO THE GOVERNMENT 
TREASURY ACCOUNT. 
  
NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED INTO 
THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 
2002. THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF-KIN 
IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE DECEASED (CUSTOMER) WAS A 
FOREIGNER. 
  
THE MODE OF SHARING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE MONEY INTO YOUR 
ACCOUNT: 60% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; FOR THE ROLE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED

Russell Turpin:
That depends on how the list is collected, or
even on what the senders say about how the list
is collected. Better to just put it on a website,
and that way it can be surfed anonymously. AND
it doesn't clutter my inbox.
It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  
Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.
But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.

FYI, I'll never trust such a scheme:  I have no tolerance for false
positives, and indeed do nothing to try to block spam on any of my email

            We are not looking for class presidents, beautiful

   We don't even want union workers or trade school graduates.
         We want the laziest people that exist - the guys and 
       gals who expect to make money without lifting a finger.  
           We want the people who stay in bed until noon.
    We want those of you who think that getting out of bed to go 
      lay on the couch is an effort that is best not thought about.
                          If you meet these criteria, go to:
                         livinghealthytoday@hotmail.com

                             ""I do not want to work"".  
            In fact, if you are so lazy that typing those words 
             in the Subject line is an effort, than don't bother.  
         Just click on the email and we'll know that you want

               In case you haven't figured it out yet, we want 
                 the kind of people who DO NOT take risks.  
        If you are the kind of person who will consider doing 
     something that's NOT a 'sure thing', then do NOT respond.  
                  This is too easy a way to make money 
                         and there's no challenge in it.
            If you can get to the website that we are going 
              to email you, you will be able to see the first

            want to make enough money that you can quit 
                     your regular job and sleep all day.  
             We are not looking for a commitment from you

                    to make money without working for it just

As a workaround, the various distributions could use a GPG singature
to verify correctness of the file.  Since the distributor's secret key
is required to create that signature, it would add a pretty
significant step that would have to be taken to make it possible to
replace both a rpm or apt file and its accompanying signature.
There are complex problems inherent in attempts to implement this.

Also correct, though procmail per se is not needed, as other filters (such

This too was not news to the theoreticians: All

Reply-To: Phil Duncan <PDuncan@AggregateStudio.com>

The following prayer is from a story by Mark Twain, and was quoted by
Lewis
Laphan in the October issue of Harper's magazine. It occurs at the
very
end
of an excellent article which I recommend to you.

In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has
been
listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by
young
patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays
the
following:

""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with
our
shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of
their
patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the
shrieks of
their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble
homes
with
a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending
widows
with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their
little
children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in
rags
and
hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy
winds of
winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the
refuge
of
the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast
their
hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make
heavy
their
steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the
blood
of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is
the
Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all
that
are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts.
Amen.""

Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American
occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until
1923,
thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it
""unsuitable""
for publication at the time it was written.

What has MIME to do with it?  I read in perldoc M:A that your suggestion

M:A, for some reason, changes its base class depending on whether the
incoming message is mime or not.  Therefore the Mail::Internet methods
suddenly become unavailable for MIME messages...

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If

Assuming there isn't a better way for Lotus Notes users, we could
create a ""Precedence: spam"" convention.  The only two Precedence:
headers I've seen (aside from one or two odd messages) are ""bulk"" and
""list"".  Adding a ""spam"" header makes sense given the convention.
I'd suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it's no standard header does most 
Software already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn't send auto-replies to 
mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these 
special, too. [1] says:
| Autoresponses should always contain the header
|          Precedence: junk
| Notice the spelling of ""prec-e-dence"". In particular, count the number of
| n:s (and a:s and s:es, if you're totally agraphic and/or from the United
| States). This will prevent well-tempered mail programs from generating
| bounce messages for these. If the recipient can't be reached, the
| autoresponder message is simply discarded. 
| [...]
| (For what it's worth, the meaning of the Precedence header in practice is
| that it affects Sendmail so that messages identified as less important get
| moved back in the queue under high load. [...])

Of the comments I received on AppleScript, every single one suggested I 
start with the basics, for that reason,  I'm going to take things 
step-by-step,  following my own learning process and progressing to 
gradually more difficult concepts. Despite having experience in 
programming, using a variety of languages, I initially found AppleScript 
to be quite intimidating -- mostly because something about the Script 
Editor seems less than intuitive. If you've already been dabbling in 
scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be 
targeted at novices, but I want to everyone to have the chance to get 
up to speed.
I'm off to the
Shareware Industry Conference
for the remainder of the week, 
where it's looking like the selection of stuff for Mac users will be very 
bleak. I believe the organization is targeted more toward the Windows 
community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get 
there is probably going to be in New York for MacWorld. I'll be missing 
out on the Web cast of Steve Jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place 
while I'm in the car, but at least I'll be able to catch the details at 
other Mac sites when I get to St. Louis. Internet access for the trip is 
being provided by Crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services 
I've found that can be configured to relay my Lockergnome mail so that I 
can still function on the road. I tested the service on my iBook this 
evening just to be sure.
With some luck, I may be able to get Internet access from the highway, via 
my Kyocera 6035, and see what Jobs had to say before I get to St. Louis. 
Unfortunately, there's no support for OS X yet with the 6035, so I can't 
use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the Web from my laptop. A 
landline will probably be more sensible anyway. Check my blog for some 
updates on the trip, Lori's attending too and I'm sure she'll be taking 
lots of photos, as usual.

Samba Sharing Package v1.5 [8.3MB] OS X FREE
http://xamba.sourceforge.net/ssp/
It remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application 
unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on DAVE, 
for small office or home networking of Mac/PC mixed environments, this 
is the only real alternative. Installation and configuration is almost 
painless, making it easy for your Windows machine to see apps on your 
Mac with little difficulty. The interface, like most OS X GUI apps, is 
quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection 
management, and share configuration into a convenient Prefernce pane.
GnomeSCRIPT
Technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing 
application like TextEdit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the Script 
Editor, so you might as well start there. The Script Editor is located in the 
AppleScript subfolder of your Applications folder. Opening the application for 
the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, Description 
and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons.
Ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. The 
Description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what 
it does. This is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke 
your script. If you choose to save your script as an executable application, the 
information in the description will show up in the start up screen.
The second pane is where the magic happens. In this pane you will be telling 
applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. The format for scripting 
is fairly linear. You either start your script at the top most level drilling 
down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate 
with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the 
bottom up. Telling the ""Applications"" folder to tell its ""Jake"" subfolder to tell 
the application ""Jake's Media Player,"" located in that folder to do something 
could also be written by telling the script to access ""Jake's Media Player"" 
located in the ""Jake"" subfolder of the ""Applications folder,  The upcoming example 
will make this a bit more clear.

GnomeTIP
Traditionally, Mac OS has always placed a link to various disks in use on the 
desktop, which can be convenient, but is no longer necessary with the Finder 
only a Command+Tab away in the Dock. My personal desktop is usually cluttered 
with files I've downloaded from the Internet, so I can never find anything 
when my desktop is in plain sight, the Finder is the only way I stay organized. 
For desktop slobs like me, or for neat freaks who want nothing on the desktop, 
OS X includes three handy options for keeping disks in their place. Open the 
Finder Preferences window and uncheck the three checkboxes under Show these 
items on the Desktop. You'll have more space for other icons to clutter the 
desktop or in the case of you clean folk, you'll have nothing at all.

Javawalk is a coffee-oriented walking-tour of San Francisco. 
    Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square 
    and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's 
    Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more 
    significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool 
    weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. 
    Lucky us!

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.
There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
That does not make a difference.
It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from

configure that probably.
Any idea how I would do this?

The enabling change to ""ftoption.h"" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before

So if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.

Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.

ham,"> What's an auto-ham?

Automatically marking something as ham after a given
timeout.. regardless of how long that timeout is, someone is going
to forget to submit the message back as spam.
OK, here's a refinement.  Assuming very little spam comes through, we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config
parameter).
How many spams-as-hams can be accepted before the f-n rate gets
unacceptable?
Config parameter.
I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with
various email clients can be achieved.

I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the
recipient, rather than make any assumptions after some period of
time passes. But this is an end-user issue and we're still at the
algorithm stage.. ;-)
I'm trying to think about the end-user issues because I have nothing
to contribute to the algorithm at this point.  For deployment we need
both!

ham,"This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
mh.
Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that 
facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
spool.
I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:
1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This 
means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will 
look like "">From "".
2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".  When I was 
having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.
3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
everything works.

2121 Alton Parkway, Suite 250
Irvine CA 92606
July 24, 2002
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS KILLING THE STOCK MARKET
       IRVINE, CA -- The steep decline in the stock market is being fueled
by investors' realization that increasing government constraints on
corporate America will harm business and the economy--not help them, said
Yaron Brook, executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute.
       ""Instead of launching a witch-hunt against CEOs and rushing to give
the government wider powers over business, we should get rid of the complex
and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent
shareholders from acting in their own interest.""
       ""The common explanation that 'greed' is to blame makes no sense--the
abuses in companies like Enron and WorldCom were not exercises in
self-interest, but in self-destruction.
       ""In an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by
honest, long-range, rational behavior: by innovating, by hiring the best
employees, by selling quality products and by providing accurate information
to the owners of the corporation--the shareholders. As for short-range
managers, the markets will not tolerate them. As for the real swindlers,
existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us.""
       ""If our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market,""
said Dr. Brook, ""let them demonstrate it by eliminating, not adding,
regulations and making the market truly free.""

ham,"Hi,
In my build scripts, I have problems with some of the kernel packages.
For kernel-sources, I get :
Package kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
on running apt-get install kernel-source
Now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
Second, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is 
done from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.
Thanks,
Thomas

To:    The President
From:  AB Sanni
Assalam Aleikum,
I wish to seek your assistance in a matter that needs trust secrecy and
confidentiality.
I am A. B. Sanni, a close confidant to Mohammed Abacha, son of late
General Sani Abacha, former head of state Federal Republic of Nigeria, who
ruled from November 17th 1993 to June 8th 1998 when he died suddenly in
office.
Since then, the family as a whole has been facing all sorts of
harassments, by security operatives/agents of the new Head of State
(General Obasanjo) who served a jail term under my friend's father for
coup offence. Even my friend's old mother has been detained and tortured
many times.  Mohammed is now being charged for military decision of his
father's regime e.g. the murder cases of political opponents. These
offences he knows nothing about, as he was only the Head of State's son,
not even a military man nor was he in the government. 
His father ruled for five years during which period he acquired financial
gains and property all over the world from his share of Crude Oil Sales as
the Head of State. Now, the family has lost all assets (property and money
in Nigeria) to the new government. Ref. News Watch Magazine publication of
11th to 18th October, 1999. However, they have hidden records in a secret
name with the Nigerian Insurance Deposit Corporation to access a coded
trust accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million
United States Dollars only ($338,000,000).   Mohammed is currently being
detained and tortured to sign off accounts of his late father and he has
done that but not the coded trust accounts in the name of certain
government multinational contractors that I can not disclose now.
THE AIM OF THIS LETTER IS TO REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE TO SECURE THIS
ACCOUNT IN A SAFE/CONFIDENTIAL BANK AND HELP INVEST THE MONEY FOR OUR
MUTUAL BENEFIT. We also expect to use some of our share of the money to
relocate ourselves to another safe Country because right now Nigeria is
not safe and we will like to go into hiding overseas if we can escape.
If you are interested in helping secure the accounts please contact me
immediately by email ""a_sanni@email.com"", so that we can arrange an
initial meeting in a neighboring country, thus you can present your
investment program and projects for our assessment.  Thereafter we will
sign an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) binding this business
relationship and immediately entrust you to access the coded trust
accounts in Europe valued at Three Hundred and Thirty Eight Million United
States Dollars only ($338,000,000).
We will depend on your business experience to make sure that we get
maximum returns on our investment with you.
PLEASE NOTE THAT IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE CODED TRUST ACCOUNT YOU
ARE LIKELY TO INCURE EXPENSES BUT IT WILL BE PAID BACK ONCE WE SECURE THE
DEPOSIT.  IT IS 100% SAFE FOR YOU AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 
Just forward via email your full name, phone number, fax number and bank
details as the new beneficiary to enable us make formal application for
the transfer of ownership to you.
We look forward to your helping us, but if you are not interested kindly
discard this letter and still maintain its confidentiality.

ham,"Related anecdote:
I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.
He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.
I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.
Anecdote number two:
In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.
I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who
wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a
mail order bride.
I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much
as anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.",214,ham

How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a
number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing
script to help further cleanse it?  The ""problem"" with the ham is it tends
to be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the
spam.
I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls
over and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages.  Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use.  Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call that
an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

My next (current) task is to complete the corpus I've got - it's currently
got ~ 9000 ham, 7800 spam, and about 9200 currently unsorted. I'm tossing
up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  -
previously
I've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to
pop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too,
too
tedious.
Yup, tagging data is mondo tedious, and mistakes hurt.
I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand
grepping.  Be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of
there.
I can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of
the more 'interesting' uglies. One thing I've seen (consider this
'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the
f-ps.
With probabilities favoring ham or spam?  A skip token is produced in lieu
of ""word"" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters.  It's
possible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.

_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 
I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 
On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 
I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. 
In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 
In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 
I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 
I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 
I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. 
Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI

M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.
DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on
their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in
Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked
together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid
derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter
Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
bow. Targets do not come much bigger.
Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.
Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
psi.
THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.
Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.
Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
even if they are standing on ice.
Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
sitting on a nest.
Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.
If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has
built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.
Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of
dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
tends to purge all malice back to its roots.
It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on
vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the
serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.
ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the
following.
Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing
hormones, abilities, etc.
Mind machines.
The original engraving or engram.
GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T
hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the
first job holders.
TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of
time.
My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.
The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic
Subconscious, etc.
EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.
Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever
one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the
higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or
other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.
Every extinct race, etc.
BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.

What I -said- in my post, John, was that instead of having to dole out
stupid refunds, I'd rather they save the costs incurred, knock off one
of those bullshit surcharges that they inevitably charge for promoting
services like these, and move on.  SOmething tells me, it'd balance
out.  Problem is, they're silly, they don't want to do this, and
rather than the legislation coming up with an affective means of
controlling the situation (overcharging) they impose silly
requirements like this.

So I get a check from Pac Bell today (SBC as they're called now).
Turns out, they went to the trouble of printing out, signing, sealing
and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole $0.33.

They easily spent more than this just getting the materials together.
Why the hell do companies bother to do this crap?  I mean, isn't there
a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness?  I don't think I missed
the .33, but I sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu
of being returned pennies.

I'm truly stuck on this though.  I don't know whether to frame the
check, burn it, or cash it in.  Maybe I should find a way to return to
sender, so they have to spend -more- money on giving me my .33 dues.


Does .33 even buy anything anymore?  Funny bit of it, is I couldn't

SECTION: Main News Main News; Part 1; Page 13; National Desk
LENGTH: 1013 words
BYLINE: DANA CALVO, TIMES STAFF WRITER
DATELINE: SEATTLE
BODY:
The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a
public-policy think tank here.
The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into
his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an
unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on
espresso.
That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,
and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one
that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,
after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound
of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000
residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle
also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's
Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.
A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the
tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the
consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,""
said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was
common sense.""
Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that
people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But
because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on
espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.
Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a
year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research
shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.
Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The
think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.
Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs
made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would
provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,
improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.
At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.
Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an
extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with
it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got
to come from somewhere.""
Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she
brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She
supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on
the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.
Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.
David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a
day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for
one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a
leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I
think everyone should pay.""
Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as
JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's
Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,
Starbucks and Tully's.
The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that
contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare
for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If
espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a
city audit.
University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. 
""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is
neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead
to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to
avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using
finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]
and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be
right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal
fees that could have gone to child care.
""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious
idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso
drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with
the espresso drinkers?""
In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public
stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,
corporations continually advertise their commitment to social
activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members
prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.
""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and
childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we
contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not
understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an
additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single
consumer product.""
The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before
voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at
vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.
The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.
Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime
every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.
It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds
funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virture of its nature as being utterly confidencial and top secret. all though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, let me start by introducing myself properly to you.
I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department of Union Bank of NIgeria (U.B.N. Headquarters Lagos Nigeria) formally Union Bank of Switzerland(UBS-AG Zurich Switzerland). In accordance with Federal Government Policies on indiginalization Law on company and Allied matters of Jan 1977. I am writing you this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.We discovered an abandoned sum of US$7. 5 million(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our Foreign customer who died along side his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since this development, we have advertised for his next of kin or any close relation to come forward to claim this money, but nobody came to apply for the claim.To this effect, I and two other officials in my department, have decided to look for a trusted foreign partner who can stand in as the next of  kin to the deceased and claim this money.
We need !a foreign partner to apply for the claim because of the fact that the customer was a foreigner and we don't want this money to go into the Banks Treasury as unclaimed fund. Every document to affect this process will emanate from my table and I will perfect every document to be in accordance with the banking law and guidelines, So you have nothing to worry about.We have agreed that 20% of the money will be for you, 10% for expenses incurred on both sides, 10% will be donated to the charity organization while 60% will be for my colleagues and I. 
If you are going to help me, indicate by replying this letter and putting in your BANK PARTICULARS, PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.I await your immediate reply to enable us start this transaction in earnest.Once I receive your reply, I will send you the Text of application for immediate application of Claim.

Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET
MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.
Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.
They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.
But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.
""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""",2487,ham

Ah, sorry for not making that clearer.
But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point whi
     le
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.

Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

ham,"This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general
dealing-with-SPAM issue.
What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That
pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""
But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.
Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.
So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access
DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)

Una de las características relevantes es el hecho de que dichas plantas quedaran conectadas al Sistema del Comercio Mundial (WTS) con acceso a mas de 50 millones de mercancias, materia primas, productos, servicios y las operaciones automaticas de comercio internacional. 
Resulta obvio que por razones economicas, de costes y de impacto social, lo apropiado es instalar plantas ensambladoras en los mismos paises y regiones asi como utilizar los recursos locales (mano de obra, ciertos equipamientos, etc.)

What do you mean by ""CD-Key or the like"" (I presume that ""of"" was a
typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""?
""of"" was a typo
Unbreakable would mean here that no one, even previously authorised entity, 
could use the system without paying the periodic subscription fee.
You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
solve, and about the constraints involved.
It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.
Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  
Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

Spam is *the* tool for dissident news, since the fact that it's unsolicited 
means that recipients can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.
That depends on how the list is collected, or
even on what the senders say about how the list
is collected. Better to just put it on a website,
and that way it can be surfed anonymously. AND
it doesn't clutter my inbox.

Cool --- I wasn't aware that the US had lifted it's population out

:-).
Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
of slaves, who were brought here by force.
More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.
Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
wealth has nothing to do with it.
It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
statistical sophistry.
Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
they're nowhere near the top.
 
Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list:
""and not a single Astor, Vanderbilt or Morgan rates a mention on the 
current Forbes Four Hundred. ""
But you have to studiously ignore the 4 Rockefellers, 3 Gettys, 3 
Hearsts,  Fords, Kelloggs, Wrigleys,
and so on.
There are more self-made people on the list than I previously alluded to 
- I made a mistake. Most
of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League dropouts, 
suggesting to me that they weren't
exactly poor to start with. Some of them have lovely self-made stories

It should not be enjoyed during pregnancy nor is it intended to supercede physician’s care in any regard.
=======================================================Here is what our customers are saying about the Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) phenomenon:
“To whom it may concern,
I was skeptical when I first read your ad.  I grew up in the 70’s & 80’s.  I was a hard core (alternative smoker) then.  So I knew my stuff.  But drug tests stopped that!  Now I am disabled from a degenerative muscle, ligament, and tendon disease.  I was smoking (an illegal product) for the pain and nausea.  Now I have something just as good; Temple 3, but cheaper, and it is legal!  I also have a lot of trouble sleeping, but the Capillaris Herba made into tea works and smells great!  Your products that I tried so far, are as good or better than your ads say!  That is hard to find nowadays in a company.  Who ever put this stuff together is a botanical genius.  I will be a customer for life!  Also, I talked with a lady on the phone when I was ordering, and asked her to find out if I could get my products and samples to hand out for free.  And just send the customers to you.  Or get a discount on products that I could sell retail to people.  I would prefer the earlier one becau!
se!
, I can just talk about your products, I am a great salesman (about 10 years experience), I could hand out flyers, give out little 1 gram pieces as samplers with your business card enclosed, etc.. I am going to be unable to work a regular job for a while, maybe indefinitely?  This deal would give me my own products and samples for free?  You would get free advertising, word of mouth, samples into peoples hands to try, someone that is very good with computers, someone who studied about mail order, Internet, cold calling, small business, good with people, etc..  I would like to be doing something, even if I would get on Social Security Disability.  It is very disheartening not being able to work to support my 2 teenage boys, or do a lot of the things I used to do!  At least I would be able to do something worthwhile.  And great products makes it real easy to sell.  Let me know what you think?
Sincerely,
RJ”

“Thank you so much for the Ragga.  It is everything you guys claim, and then some!  I was a bit skeptical when I read your description of its effects, but there is literally no exaggeration in your advertisements.  How nice that this is non-prohibited!  It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.”

Location: West Coast, USA
“I’m a man of my 40’s and I really know my stuff.  I don’t drink or do illegal drugs anymore and have found a much more spiritual path.  I used to have to take Valium in the past.  Not anymore with the Temple “3”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!”

=======================================================Finally, we realize of course that this Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) is not inexpensive…. (Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) is a very, very Sweet Smoke and “sweetness” is never acquired inexpensively.  Such is the way of the Economic Tao....), nor, as a matter of fact, is it inexpensive for us to acquire, factor or master-craft….  Quite simply, it is the very best of its Kind that there is to be acquired.  Just a snippet/pinch of this Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM)…. Four or five draws of your pipe….as is the magical way….lingers for a good, goodly while!!!  (An herb pipe and usage instructions are included with each Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) Package.)
“Seventh Heaven” Temple “3” Ragga Dagga (TM) is offered exclusively in 56 gram (2 oz.) and 22 gram (.75 oz.) jiggets/bars for $115.00 and $65.00 respectively.  Sorry, no volume discounts.  Wholesale pricing is available to qualified, select merchants only.

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

Equivalence Tablets & Dragon Wing Spray Remedials are comprised of entirely natural botanical factors.

We All
Need a Good Attorney to Call in Today's Society.
Keeping ahead of the legal issues in our life was just simply more than we could
bear. We needed legal advice and we needed it right away. Unfortunately, being middle class, put us in the wrong income bracket to have such a necessity. Now all of this has changed.
Think about the issues that can suddenly come up in your personal life:
Monday:
The dog bit the mailman - Do you know what to do?
Tuesday:
The Building Inspector drops by and announces that the permits on file with their office do not
    allow your garage conversion. ""What now,"" you think to yourself.
Wednesday:
You've been considering home-schooling your children for some time. Now your daughter announces that she is being picked on yet again, and simply will not attend another day. What are the legal ramifications of home schooling your children?
Thursday:
Speeding Ticket goes to warrant for your 17-year-old son. You haven't a clue how to handle
    it.
Friday:
Your ex-spouse has missed another child support payment. . . Who do you call?
And what about all the other things:
Received a Traffic Ticket You Thought Was Unjustified?
Paid a Bill You Knew Was Unfair?
Lost a Security Deposit?
Bought a Home or Purchased A Car?
Signed an Employment Contract?
Had difficulty collecting an insurance claim?
Had Trouble With Your Credit Report?
Been Involved in a Landlord or Property Dispute?
Been Involved in a separation or divorce?
Had to Collect Child Support?
Prepared A Will or Wanted To?
In your personal life, you need legal representation available to you all the time. But most of us never have it because we can't afford it.
Now there is a program that not only provides quality legal help,
but it provides it 24 hours a day
, with an attorney helping you the same day you call them -
and it is for a small monthly fee
. No Kidding.
Somewhere between twenty and forty dollars a month, depending upon the plan you choose.

I had to laugh at Rumsfield yesterday - when he was heckled by
protestors, he said something like ""They couldn't do that in Iraq.""
Meanwhile, from what I could tell, the protestors were being arrested.

Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is
trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.

Carny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations: 
    In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country. 
    ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste 
    our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled 
    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of 
    Seattle. 
    As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top... 
    Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 
    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and 
    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began 
    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions. 
    How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an 
    estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular email clients"".. As a 
stop-gap to the auto-ham ..
How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email 
clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move ""spam"" into the spam 
folder. 
Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can 
quickly move ham into the ham folder.
In either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.

.If you're sick of scams, then read this, and do what it says.
I WILL MAKE YOU A PROMISE. Read this email to the end, follow the
instructions, and you won't have to worry about funding your
retirement, having money to play, or making ends meet... EVER. I
know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these
before either. Then one day I realized that I throw away $25
going to a movie for 2 hours with my wife, why not try investing
this same $25 in a system that just might work. I don't know why
that day I decided to take a chance, but I can't even come close
to imagining if I hadn't - I guess I'd still be poor.
Read on.  It's true. Every word of it. It's legal, and it's ethical.
Not only are you making money from your own business, you're
helping other people achieve their goals and fulfill their dreams.
Give it a shot, you'll see there is absolutely no way you won't get
AT LEAST a modest return on your start up capital.
Okay - here's the scoop on CashByNet (CBN):
=================================================
Due to the popularity of this particular email business, and the
business potential of the Internet, a national weekly news program
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program
to see if it's legal, and if it really can make people money.
Their findings proved that there are ""absolutely NO LAWS prohibiting
the participation in the program, and if people can follow a few
simple instructions they are bound to make amazing returns with only
$25 in startup costs.""
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.  THE MORE PEOPLE
WHO PARTICIPATE, THE BETTER OFF YOU BECOME, AND THE MORE INCOME YOU
WILL MAKE.
This is what one had to say:
""I was approached many times before to participate in Cash By Net, but
each time I passed on it. One day I decided that instead of going out
that night, I would take the money I would have spent - invest it in
this business, and see if it was as lucrative as everyone claimed.
Two weeks went by . . . . nothing.  Three weeks . . . . $50 dollars
rolled in.  At this point I was just relieved to get my money back.
Then it happened - One week after this, I opened my mailbox to find
$580 in $5 bills waiting for me.  Its been about 8 months now, and I
just bought a new Mercedes . . . black :)  The startup costs are so
small, and the time involved is less than 5 hours per week.
Give it a shot - what do you have to lose?""
Pam Hedland, South Bound Brook, New Jersey.
=================================================
Another said:
""Programs like this have been around for a long time but I never
believed in them. But this year I won a $50 bet on the Patriots to
win the Super Bowl.  I got this email the following morning, and I
felt like gambling.  I spent $25 ordering the reports, and the other
$25 paying a parking ticket.  I followed the instructions
meticulously - I thought I would at least get my original $25 back.
As soon as I got the email out, not One week went by before I quadrupled
my $25.  I'd take that over the Patriots any day.  I got excited, and
that's when it started to explode.  In less than 6 weeks I was already
up $9500 bucks.  It's been almost 4 months, and the flow hasn't stopped.
On an average day, I get anwhere from $500 - $1500 in the mail.  I always
say that everything happens for a reason, and I feel that this was meant
to be, maybe it is for you too. Just stick to the steps, do everything it
says - and all of your hopes and dreams will be real - I promise.""

ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON
THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

and redistribute them. YOUR TOTAL START UP INVESTMENT: $5 X 5 = $25.00.
Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports
from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they
will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it
on your desk in case something happens to your computer.
IMPORTANT - DO NOT ALTER THE NAMES OR SEQUENCE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
LISTED NEXT TO EACH REPORT.  FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS 1-6 VERY CLOSELY
OR YOU WILL LOSE OUT ON THE MAJORITY OF THE PROFIT WHICH IS DUE TO
YOU!! Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how
it does not work if you alter it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and proved and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!!
This is a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and
getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable
in a short period of time, and have something many people can't - a
profitable business enterprise (and more money to do WHATEVER YOU COULD

As soon as you receive all 5 reports via email SAVE A COPY OF THEM!
These are the products that your customers are paying for. Not only do
these reports hold the secrets and instructions for your new venture,
you will be redistributing them to customers when you receive payment.
To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports will provide you with valuable marketing information on how to
send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified
ads and much more.
There are 2 Primary methods you will use to get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
=================================================
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails
each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2%
(2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just
say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of
thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Continuing with this
example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.
With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1.  Those 10
people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.
Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100
people responded and ordered Report # 2.
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000
e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.
Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail
sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million
dollars).
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
REMEMBER, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails
each or more?

METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
=================================================
Advertising on the net is extremely inexpensive and there are hundreds
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet
will easily get a larger response than just emails alone. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you begin to
become more knowledgeable about the business and study the 5 reports.
Remember to always provide same day service on all orders to ensure
proper return on the back end - this means quicker profits for you.
$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.
**ONCE YOU HAVE RECEIVED 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR REPORT # 2, YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash
will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a
different report.
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER
BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT
to the income you can generate from this business !!!

Weird.  I had no problems at all rebuilding from the SRPM with specfile
modified to enable the bytecode interpreter.  The ""check-files"" test
warns that ""/usr/share/aclocal/freetype2.m4"" was not included in any

Hi, Ben,
it seems, the RH freetype package should be repacked,

Please, can you atach and send your sucessfully rebuild of the RH freetype

I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal

Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org

length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of

gatewaying their messages without asking.
Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't

But for personal email, we should be more careful.

I thought about that.  The first order approximation would be to just add 
using pack .... -side top instead of pack ... -side left, however, since their 
each a different width, it would look funny.
I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.
I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

View this issue as simple text
September 10, 2002
In this Issue
WELCOME to the Core Java
TM
Technologies Tech Tips, September 10, 2002. Here you'll get tips on using core Java technologies and APIs, such as those in Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE
TM
).
Using ArrayList and LinkedList
Using Zero-Length Arrays
These tips were developed using Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v 1.4.
This issue of the JDC Tech Tips is written by Glen McCluskey.
USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST
ArrayList
and
LinkedList
are two
Collections
classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an
ArrayList
of Strings, or a
LinkedList
of Integers. This tip compares the performance of
ArrayList
and
LinkedList
, and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.
The first key point is that an
ArrayList
is backed by a primitive
Object
array. Because of that, an
ArrayList
is much faster than a
LinkedList
for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the
get
method. Note that the
get
method is implemented for
LinkedLists
, but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a
LinkedList
, there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.
Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
. Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.
Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
:
import java.util.*;
    public class ListDemo1 {
        static final int N = 10000;
        static List values;
        // make List of increasing Integer values
        static {
           Integer vals[] = new Integer[N];
           Random rn = new Random();
           for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i < N; i++) {
               vals[i] = new Integer(currval);
               currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
           }
           values = Arrays.asList(vals);
        }
        
        // iterate across a list and look up every
        // value in the list using binary search
        static long timeList(List lst) {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
               // look up a value in the list 
               // using binary search
               int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                   lst, values.get(i));
               // sanity check for result 
               // of binary search
               if (indx != i) {
                   System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
               }
           }
           return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
       }
       public static void main(String args[]) {
           // do lookups in an ArrayList 
           System.out.println(""time for ArrayList = "" +
               timeList(new ArrayList(values)));
           // do lookups in a LinkedList
           System.out.println(
               ""time for LinkedList = "" +
               timeList(new LinkedList(values)));
       }
    }
The
ListDemo1
program sets up a
List
of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
. Then
Collections.binarySearch
is used to search for each value in the 
list.
When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:
time for ArrayList = 31
    time for LinkedList = 4640
ArrayList
is about 150 times faster than
LinkedList
. (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for
ArrayList
as compared to that for
LinkedList
. The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly,
LinkedList
is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and
LinkedList
does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a
LinkedList
is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an
ArrayList
has a fixed time.
You can use the
RandomAccess
marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:
void f(List lst) {
        if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {
            // supports fast random access
        }
    }
ArrayList
implements the
RandomAccess
interface, and
LinkedList
. does not. Note that
Collections.binarySearch
does take advantage of the
RandomAccess
property, to optimize searches.
Do these results prove that
ArrayList
is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where
LinkedList
does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for
LinkedList
. An example is reversing a
LinkedList
using
Collections.reverse
. The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.
Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case,
LinkedList
is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following ""worst case"" scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:
import java.util.*;
    public class ListDemo2 {
        static final int N = 50000;
        // time how long it takes to add 
        // N objects to a list
        static long timeList(List lst) {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
            Object obj = new Object();
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                lst.add(0, obj);
            }
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            // do timing for ArrayList
            System.out.println(
                ""time for ArrayList = "" +
                timeList(new ArrayList()));
            // do timing for LinkedList
            System.out.println(
                ""time for LinkedList = "" +
                timeList(new LinkedList()));
        }
    }
When you run this program, the result should look something like this:
time for ArrayList = 4859
    time for LinkedList = 125
These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.
When an element is added to the beginning of an
ArrayList
, all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a
LinkedList
simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a
LinkedList
has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an
ArrayList
has a cost that's proportional to the list size.
So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how
ArrayList
and
LinkedList
are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.
The
LinkedList
class has a private internal class defined like this:
private static class Entry {
        Object element;
        Entry next;
        Entry previous;
    }
Each
Entry
object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the
LinkedList
-- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A
LinkedList
of 1000 elements will have 1000
Entry
objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a
LinkedList
structure, given all these
Entry
objects.
An
ArrayList
has a backing
Object
array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:
newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;
Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an
ArrayList
with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way
ArrayList
works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.
If you know how many elements will be in an
ArrayList
, you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the
trimToSize
method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.
So far, this discussion has assumed that either an
ArrayList
or a
LinkedList
is ""right"" for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.
You could store the pairs in an N x 2
Object
array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.
Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of
ArrayLists
, and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a
HashMap
.
Which is faster, a binary search on an
ArrayList
, or a
HashMap
? Here's a final example that compares these two:
import java.util.*;
    public class ListDemo3 {
        static final int N = 500000;
        // Lists of keys and values
        static List keys;
        static List values;
        // fill the keys list with ascending order key 
        // values and fill the values list with
        // corresponding values (-key)
        static {
            Integer keyvec[] = new Integer[N];
            Integer valuevec[] = new Integer[N];
            Random rn = new Random();
            for (int i = 0, currval = 0; i < N; i++) {
                keyvec[i] = new Integer(currval);
                valuevec[i] = new Integer(-currval);
                currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;
            }
            keys = Arrays.asList(keyvec);
            values = Arrays.asList(valuevec);
        }
        // fill a Map with key/value pairs
        static Map map = new HashMap();
        static {
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i));
            }
        }
        // do binary search lookup of all keys
        static long timeList() {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                int indx = Collections.binarySearch(
                                    keys, keys.get(i));
                // sanity check of returned value 
                // from binary search
                if (indx != i) {
                    System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
                }
            }
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
        // do Map lookup of all keys
        static long timeMap() {
            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                Integer value = (Integer)map.get(
                                          keys.get(i));
                // sanity check of value returned 
                // from map lookup
                if (value != values.get(i)) {
                    System.out.println(
                                    ""*** error ***\n"");
                }
            }
            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;
        }
        public static void main(String args[]) {
            // do timing for List implementation
            System.out.println(""List time = "" + 
                                           timeList());
            // do timing for Map implementation
            System.out.println(""Map time = "" + 
                                            timeMap());
        }
    }
The program sets up
Lists
of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. One approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table.
When you run the
ListDemo3
program, you should get a result that looks something like this:
ArrayList time = 1000
    HashMap time = 281
In this example, N has a value of 500000. Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the
ArrayList
will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.
However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.
Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:
Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both
ArrayList
and
LinkedList.
For
ArrayList
, appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For
LinkedList
, the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal
Entry
object.
Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an
ArrayList
implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a
LinkedList
has fixed cost.
A
LinkedList
does not support efficient random access
An
ArrayList
has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A
LinkedList
has significant space overhead per element.
Sometimes a
Map
structure is a better choice than a
List
.

USING ZERO-LENGTH ARRAYS
Suppose that you are writing a Java application that involves some sort of data filtering. You have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. One of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. The method goes through the array and eliminates ""outliers,"" that is, values that are too small or too big. The result of the filtering process is a new array of cleaned-up data.
How could you implement this kind of filtering method? Here's one approach:
import java.util.*;
    
    public class ZeroDemo1 {
    
        // filter input array and throw away values 
        // that are less than minval or greater than 
        // maxval
    
        static int[] filterData(
                int indata[], int minval, int maxval) {
    
            // check parameters for errors 
    
            if (indata == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException(
                                     ""indata is null"");
            }
            if (maxval < minval) {
                throw new IllegalArgumentException(
                ""maxval < minval"");
            }
    
            // count number of valid values 
            // in input array
    
            int validcnt = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < indata.length; i++) {
                if (indata[i] >= minval && indata[i] 
                                         <= maxval) {
                    validcnt++;
                }
            }
    
            // if no valid values, return null
    
            if (validcnt == 0) {
                return null;
            }
    
            // copy valid values to new array 
            // and return it
    
            int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; 
                              i < indata.length; i++) {
                if (indata[i] >= minval && indata[i] 
                                           <= maxval) {
                    outdata[j++] = indata[i];
                }
            }
            return outdata;
        }
    
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // set up test array of integers
    
            int indata[] = new int[]{1, 3, -17, 8, 59};
    
            // filter out values not in the range 1-10
    
            int outdata1[] = filterData(indata, 1, 10);
            for (int i = 0; i < outdata1.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(outdata1[i]);
            }
    
            // filter out values not 
            // in the range 100-200
    
            int outdata2[] = filterData(
                                     indata, 100, 200);
            for (int i = 0; i < outdata2.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(outdata2[i]);
            }
        }
    }
The
filterData
method does two scans of the input array. The first scan counts the number of valid data values. Then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. If there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference.
The result of running the
ZeroDemo1
program is:
1
    3
    8
    Exception in thread ""main""
    java.lang.NullPointerException
        at ZeroDemo1.main(ZeroDemo1.java:72)
The problem with this program is a rather basic one. The second call of
filterData
returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account.
A better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values:
/*
    if (validcnt == 0) {
        return null;
    }
    */
When there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zero-length array is allocated:
int outdata[] = new int[0];
This is perfectly legal Java usage. The representation of Java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length.
For the
ZeroDemo1
example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this:
int outdata[] = new int[validcnt];
    if (validcnt == 0) {
        return outdata;
    }
Note that usage such as:
int outdata[] = new int[]{};
is also legal, to initialize an array with a zero-length set of integer constants.
In general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. Always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. If you anticipate that your methods will often return zero-length arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. In this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows:
private static final int ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAY[] = 
                                            new int[0];
This array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application.
There's another way that zero-length arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example:
import java.util.*;
    
    public class ZeroDemo2 {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // set up ArrayList and add strings to it
    
            List stringlist = new ArrayList();
            stringlist.add(""string 1"");
            stringlist.add(""string 2"");
            stringlist.add(""string 3"");
    
            // convert to String array
    
            String out[] = (
                          String[])stringlist.toArray(
            new String[0]);
            for (int i = 0; i < out.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(out[i]);
            }
        }
    }
The result of running the
ZeroDemo2
program is:
string 1
    string 2
    string 3
The
ZeroDemo2
program sets up an
ArrayList
, and adds three strings to it. Then the program calls
toArray
to get a
String
array of the three elements in the
ArrayList
. In this example, the argument to
toArray
is ""new String[0]"". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a
String
array that's big enough to hold the elements of the
ArrayList
, you can specify it as the argument to
toArray
. The method will use the
String
array.
But if your array is not big enough, then the
toArray
method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array.
ArrayList
stores its element references in an
Object
array. The
toArray
method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection (
java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance
) to create an array of the appropriate type.

C++ on the same hardware then it does matter.
Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY
matters.

The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up. 
    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.) 
    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to

Do we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from centuries past?
Eugen Leitl:
That's easy. Divorce didn't happen.
You seem not to know what a ""poor man's divorce"" is.
It is an old term, from the time when divorce was
difficult, but walking was easy, and identity was
not so locked down as it is today. Not every widow
had a dead husband.
I'm seeing lack of innovation ..
That doesn't tell us anything except what is
happening in Eugen Leitl's life. The more common
observation is that the rate of change is increasing.
Do you have any data that might persuade us that what
you see is more telling than what others see?
gerontocracy favors gerontocracy.
I would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech
research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes.
Note that the fertility rate doesn't result from
decisions made by the old, but by the young. If we
want more kids, we have to convince people who are
in their twenties to become parents.

You will probably suffer from the high latency of DLS lines.  Typically,
you're talking about 50ms RTT to the local bas, which is pretty high.
If your voip application can handle this, then you're ok.
Nick
what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

http://www.mindview.net/Calendar
==================================* Come work on Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, in Crested Butte
All but one of the Interns has departed (he's staying through
December) and we have empty rooms in the condo that I rented in Mt.
Crested Butte for the Interns to stay in. If you'd like to
volunteer to come up (Crested Butte is gorgeous in late
Summer/early Fall, with excellent hiking and mountain biking), stay
in the condo, and help work on the 3rd edition of Thinking in Java,
please email Sharlynn@Mindview.net with your resume and
availability dates (note that the book is due at the end of
October). There will be a technical and writing test, and
interviews to reveal how well you self-motivate and work with
others.
This should be a great learning experience and a fun time.
==================================* Thinking in Java, 3rd edition, Revision 2 Imminent
The second revision will be up on the site soon, at:
http://64.78.49.204/
The biggest change is that I've rewritten significant part of the
multithreading chapter (although it still has a ways to go). The
goal is to rewrite the chapter to introduce the essence of
threading with simplicity, and without GUI examples (this
simplifies things, and allows threads to appear before GUIs).
The chapters have also been reorganized into something like their
final form, although the final chapter numbering hasn't been done
yet. We have made more progress in the testing system.
Other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the
beginning of the book.
The book is due at the end of October. The print version will
appear in December.
==================================* Thinking in C++, Volume 2, Revision 9 Available tomorrow
Available at:
http://64.78.49.204/
Chapters 1-4 are finished
==================================* Thinking in Java Hands-on Seminar
November 4th-8th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/ThinkingInJava/
Created by Bruce Eckel, taught by Andrea Provaglio. We believe this
is the best in-depth introduction to Java that you'll find.  It's
based on the book ""Thinking in Java,"" which was created as the
seminar evolved.
Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,600 for payments received by October 12th
* $1,950 for payments received after October 12th
==================================* Java2 Enterprise Programming Seminar
November 18th-22th in San Francisco - Emeryville, CA.
Registration opens on September 4th.
http://www.mindview.net/Seminars/J2EE/
Created and taught by Andrea Provaglio, this seminar introduces you
to the practical development of real-world, Web-enabled,
distributed applications with Java. It covers J2EE and its key
technologies: Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java ServerPages, and
the basic architectural patterns used to combine these technologies
into maintainable applications. 
Andrea has been teaching this course in the US and in Europe for
the last two years, and he has recently restructured and updated
the seminar to include the latest J2EE features.
You'll come out of this course with a comprehensive understanding
of the J2EE architecture, of the problems that it is designed to
solve, how to select the most appropriate tools, and how to code
your solutions.
Please note the early registration discount: 
* $1,700 for payments received by October 26th
* $2,300 for payments received after October 26th
==================================* New seminars
Bill Venners and I just finished giving the last ""Objects &
Patterns"" seminar, and everyone (especially us) had a great time.
We are now beginning to work towards the two new seminars spawned
by Objects & Patterns, which Bill and I plan to teach together:
Design Patterns in Java
(Drawing primarily from ""Thinking in Patterns"")
Designing Objects & Systems
This will include a lot of material from Bill's upcoming book on
Object Design, along with coverage of UML, XP, Object-Oriented
Design techniques and guidelines, and of course exercises and
projects.
We hope to begin teaching the courses early next year. Stay tuned.
==================================* Limited Number of Signed Copies of TIJ2 for sale
I'm selling the last 17 of my author copies of Thinking in Java,
2nd edition. I've signed each one and drawn a little cartoon with
the signature (the books are in La Mesa, and I'm in Crested Butte,
so unfortunately I can't personalize them). The cost in the USA is
$40, which includes handling and mailing. Outside the USA, you'll
have to email to the address below to find out the additional
shipping cost.
To order, divide your credit card number (Visa, MC, Amex) into two
different emails (not high security, but highly likely to be safe),
and include your credit card billing address and expiration date.
Email your order to:
Wayne@MindView.net
Wayne will email you back to clarify any necessary details.

GNU/DEVELOPMENT, INTERNATIONAL ORGANISATION TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT GNU/LINUX
From Frederick Noronha
INDIA: There's good news round the corner -- international organisations and
prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of
Free/Open Source Software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the
immense promise it holds out to the Third World.
But can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? 
From the Unesco to the World Bank, and other global organisations, all are
catching up on the potential of using GNU/Linux as a potent tool in working
towards development. More so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial
office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's
earnings.
United Nation's Development Programme's Ms. Radhika Lal
<radhika.lal@undp.org>, a Information-Communication Technology Policy
Advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on Open Source for
E-Government. It is to be held in Washington, DC on October 17-18.
infoDev, the Cyberspace Policy Institute of The George Washington
University, and the UNDP are jointly behind this event. It is intended to
draw participants from local, national and international organizations from
both the public and private sector.
This meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness
about the potential of open source and free software for e-governance. More
importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors,
users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in Open Source,
e-Government and related fields.
Ms Lal works at the ICT-for-Development's Special Initiative Bureau for
Development Policy at the UNDP's East 45th Street offices in New York.
ICT-for-development is a campaign to use more of infotech and the Internet
for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy.
But despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the GNU/Linux world,
so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles.
See http://www.egovos.org/
OTHER ARMS OF THE U.N.
=====================
Besides, the UNDP, other arms of the United Nations are also known to be
showing increasing interest in the potential of free software/open source
tools. 
Paris-headquartered Unesco (United Nations Education, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation) recently launched its own Free Software portal. 
It's at http://www.unesco.org/webworld/portal_freesoft.
UNESCO's Jean-Claude Dauphin <jc.dauphin@unesco.org> of the Information
Society Division also announced that this international organisation has
been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the Free Software
movement in relation with UNESCO fields of competence -- education, science
and culture.
It zeroed in particularly on those coming from the Third World (also called
the 'South' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising,
updating and extending the UNESCO Free Software Portal"" as well as for

NEW TOOLS FOR CDS/ISIS
=====================
Recently, Unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange
from and to its CDS/ISIS software. These two new tools -- ImpExp2709 and
IsisAscii v 0.92 -- have recently been released for data exchange from and
to UNESCO's software package CDS/ISIS. 
CDS/ISIS is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is
freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within
the Third World. The new utilities have been released with their source code
(GPL license). 
See http://www.unesco.org/webworld/news/2002/020806_isis.shtml
Meanwhile, UNDP's APDIP (Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme)
based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously
about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, GNU/Linux and
related issues.
""We want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" APDIP's Shahid
Akhtar told this correspondent.
Niranjan Rajani <niranjan.rajani@maailma.net>, of Pakistani origin but based
in the birthplace of Linux, Finland, is now working on a research project on
""Significance of Free/OpenSource Software for Developing Countries"".
This project is financed by the Finnish Foreign Ministry, and he has
undertaken to write the paper by the end of November this year, for
Maailma.Net, a local division of OneWorld.Net.
This project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use
of FS/OSS, especially some of its most significant and popular projects;
GNU/Linux, Apache, Mozilla, OpenOffice etc. in the developing or Third World
countries. It will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies
and lives of these countries.
CONVINCING GOVERNMENTS
=====================
In India, organisations like Red Hat have been putting out slick
presentations to convince governments and officials to try out Open Source. 
Shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. That's
the message that governments across India were recently with, as official
computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and
speedy software-fuelled hardware obsolence.
Senior IT and e-governance officials from across the country tuned in
attentively during a recent seminar in Goa, as executives from computing
giant IBM and leading Linux systems supplier Red Hat India narrated long
lists of benefits that governments could get from going the Linux way.
Pointing to examples from across the globe, Red Hat India argued that the US
Department of Energy has built supercomputers on GNU/Linux, the Chinese are
making Linux the official server operating system -- to be widely used in
varsities, military installations and within government. 
Some months back, an organisation under India's Ministry of Information
Technology -- called the ER&DCI (Electronics Research and Development Centre
of India) -- entered into a strategic alliance with leading Linux systems
supplier Red Hat India to popularize the 'open source' solution in the
government sector.
On networks like the EDC/World Bank-support GKD (Global Knowledge for
Development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the
news.
GNU/Linux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed
out. (See http://www.lincproject.org)
""The Low Income Networking and Communication (LINC) Project of the Welfare
Law Center has helped many low-income led organizing groups acquire access
to the Internet and use technology more effectively,"" says Dirk Slater
<dirk@welfarelaw.org>. 
While these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one
another and their allies by using the Internet, one communication hurdle
remains -- communicating with their leadership via the Internet. 
Despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the Internet
in low-income communities, access is still an issue. 
Public Internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not
sufficient, as Slater has pointed out. Many low-income leaders do not have
access to the Internet where it would make the most impact -- in their
homes. 
LINC argues that the need for Internet communication is particularly great
for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent
face-to-face meetings because of distance, time and money constraints.
""We began to explore the idea of using Linux, a free operating system that
works well on older computers, when we learned of Microsoft's decision to
discontinue support of its older operating systems like Windows 95<
according to Slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the Low-Income
Networking and Communications (LINC) Project at the Welfare Law Center.
LINC protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems
that occur for Windows users just by having Windows run on its own. ""Giving
a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with Windows seemed
like we were just asking for trouble. We also attempted to identify similar
projects but had limited success,"" says Slater. 
LINC wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using
donated computers for board members and leaders of low-income led
organizations that LINC serves. 
""Our goal is to increase the ability of LINC Project partner groups to use
open-source software to support their organizing work. We also wanted to
document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide
details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" LINC
explains.
LINC identified a partner in Grass Roots Organizing in Mexico, MO, and
installed GNU/Linux on 10 computers used as stand-alone workstations in
people's homes. GNU/Linux was also installed on a brand new stand-alone
computer to work as the main computer in the GRO office.
Links were built with the Mizzou Linux Users Group for ongoing local
support.
""We still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely
successful project. After a period of a few months we will assess whether
the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more
effectively,"" said Slater.
To view the daily journals on the project with GRO please visit the LINC

NEED TO NETWORK
==============
Bala Pillai <bala@tamil.net>, who was earlier based in Malaysia and now in
Sydney-Australia, is founder of Tamil Innaiyam (http://www.tamil.net), an
organisation to promote the Tamil language worldwide. He points to the
impact GNU/Linux is making in some distant areas of the Third World.
Says Pillai: ""The most interactive open source/Linux community in our time
zone/Asia springs out of the Philippines. Primarily because the Filipino
psyche is a more secure psyche, a more self-confident psyche. 
""Folks who are self-confident worry about the future less, and allocate more
time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and re-echoing it.
Filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing -- we should look to
more symbiosis with them,"" says he. 
Pillai also notes that the Manila-based Miguel Paraz, whom he interacted
with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the Filipino Linux community.
""http://www.q-linux.com is a good starting point to get a feel for the key
Open Source catalysts in the Philippines,"" says he. 
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia-based Dinesh who runs http://www.alphaque.com is
another lead Open Source catalyst from the region, explains Pillai. ""Do look
for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. 
""I see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. For example, there is
likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or
publicizing where there is over-duplication. If we coordinated ourselves and
found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this
work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.

Subject: Attn programmers: support offered [FLOSS-Sarai Initiative]
Date: 8 Sep 2002 01:25:45 GMT
Dear friends,
Can we manage to get some money into backing Free/Libre Open Source
Software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to
support their cash-strapped initiatives? 
Sarai.net, a Delhi-based initiative under the CSDS (Centre for the Study
of Developing Societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea.
Jeebesh Bagchi <jeebesh@sarai.net> sent in this offer recently. It could
surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to
make a break in Free Software/Open Source, but hamstrung by resources. 
It might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely 
workable, I guess. This is my own gut-level feeling, but maybe bigger
initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. If
such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for
greater support to free software/open source developers in regions like
ours. --FN

somehow failing to provide it with input.
Try tweaking the scripts to run ""gs"" with the ps file on

That might clarify that the later part of the system works, but I

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.
If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good
September 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 
 
Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. 
But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 
""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 
Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" 
That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. 
Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. 
As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" 
Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. 
""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 
Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" 
The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 
How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" 
Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""
Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" 
At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 
A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 
Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" 
Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 
Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 
Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. 
""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" 
Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" 
""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 
Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. 
But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. 
""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 
Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 
""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""

Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have 
resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented, 
dysfunctional kids ..
Don't swallow too quickly what you have read about
more traditional cultures, today or in the past. Do
we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from
centuries past? Are you so sure that the kids in 18th
century England were any more ""functional"" than those
today? What about 20th century Saudi Arabia?
At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and 
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.
Granting your first two points, I'm skeptical about
the last. Do you see ANY signs that America specifically
or the west generally are suffering from lack of
innovation, vis-a-vis youth nations such as Iran? The
last I read, the third generation of the revolution all
(a) want to move to America, and (b) failing that, are
importing everything they can American.

New Sony Vaio: When small becomes TOO small
Sometimes hardware vendors take this whole smaller-is-better thing way, way too far. Witness the Sony Vaio U1. This tiny PC--so far for sale only in Asia--is too small for a jumbo-sized Texan like me to use. But, dang, it's cute!

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.
The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.
According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.
""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.
In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.
""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.
The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.
DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.
========================================================================
DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.
DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.
DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.
""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.
""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""
""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

NEW YORK--Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs on Wednesday defended the company's switch to the Mac OS X operating system and unveiled new iPod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel iMac.
Jobs used his keynote speech at the Macworld trade show here to make a flurry of other announcements as well, such as details about new syncing software, the next update to OS X and the end of free iTools.
The most dramatic announcement focused on iPod. The new players include ones built specifically for computers that use Microsoft's Windows operating system.

Scient files for Chapter 11
Internet consulting firm Scient has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and agreed to sell certain assets to a professional services firm.
The deal calls for Salt Lake City-based SBI to hire some of Scient's employees and to provide up to $4.9 million in financing, pending completion of the asset acquisition.
Scient has been struggling for some time now. Once a dot-com darling, the company recently approved a 1-for-20 reverse stock split.
The company and SBI said they expect the bankruptcy court to approve the deal, adding that financing ""will allow Scient to continue to deliver services to its clients without interruption until court approval of SBI's acquisition is received.""

Yahoo Mail puts words in your mouth
What does Yahoo Mail have against mocha?
That's what users of the company's free e-mail service may be wondering if they try to send a message using the word ""mocha"" and discover that while in transit, ""mocha"" mysteriously changes to ""espresso.""
To protect users from malicious code, Yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" that pertain to Web code known as JavaScript.
The reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as ""Web enhanced"" can contain JavaScript instructions that can run programs on the recipient's PC. JavaScript is a Web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for example.

Microsoft sweetens Mac Office offer
With sales of its Office suite for Mac OS X falling short of projections, Microsoft plans on Wednesday to announce a rebate for those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new Mac.
The promotion, which runs through Sept. 30, entails a $50 mail-in rebate for people buying a new Mac and upgrading to Office v. X, and $100 for those buying a Mac and the full version of the software. Microsoft is also offering two new pieces of downloadable software: one that lets Palm handhelds synchronize directly with Office v. X and another that lets the Macintosh view programs running on a Windows PC or server.

New chip may portend ATI comeback
ATI, once the leader in graphics chips, will launch its comeback bid this week with a new chip that experts say could put the company back in front in terms of performance.
The Markham, Ontario-based company on Thursday will unveil the details of the Radeon 9700, a desktop graphics chip based on a new architecture that will provide greater realism when it comes to 3D images, according to sources.
The fastest versions of the new chips will offer considerably higher performance than Nvidia's current GeForce4 roster, giving ATI the edge with gamers as well as PC makers, analysts said. And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.

A whitelist is only helpful when (a) you only want mail from a limited

With SA's cooperation, though, it might be worth a try.  Even better if

rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his

ham,"right Mike,
i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is
only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant
show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am
mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.
my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways
once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see
amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on
their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just
that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family
life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion
of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of
their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of
photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes
things 'big time'.
rgds,
rob

is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users

half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.
This does nothing to answer my question.  I *do* care about content.  Hell,
if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth
all day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced
that they will (stupid or not).
While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same
argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who
communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is
such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find
yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?
I don't buy it.
For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient
mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not
nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and
such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to
get a message across.
misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the
plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital
camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.
Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just
don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this"").  I wasn't saying
that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't
easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way
that ""changed the face of communications"".
I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why
people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the
phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see
people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to
other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over
sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or
offline) photoalbum.
I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics
right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's
one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant
view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want
""instant view"", but also ""instant show"".  Which is what this service
offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"".  I think
people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put
together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while
they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but
it's just ""nice"" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral
messaging method.
What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it
from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's
silly if people are going to flock to it.
I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.
The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately
are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event
will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile
phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of
what happened - before the press even gets there.
Willing to be proven wrong,
Mike
PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as
they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.

I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can 
achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the GA scores.
The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.
The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.

You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate FNs.
DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.
Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

  | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list
That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).
Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.
  | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
  |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.
This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.
Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.
But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".
Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).

I personally don't think IMAP has a bright future, but for people who

Yes.
I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with various email clients 
can be achieved.
I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the recipient, rather than 
make any assumptions after some period of time passes. But this is an end-user issue

When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by

   Yeah, but I try to 'take it easy' on your server.  The golden rule of the internet: when you find a free resource, don't piss'em off!  :)  I really appreciate your work; you get done the things I wish I could, and I respect that.
Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I
wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is
entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/
    OK, I'll search for the ISOs on the  one remaining site that isn't hammered.  :)
Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(
    Sure: this is a linking issue, right?  Right now I'm still pure-vanilla.  I have the stock version of rpm/rpmlib/popt/etc and the recommended version of apt that you gave me.  No, wait...there's no new code getting loaded.  I don't know, either.  It's been a long day.

from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01.
The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity

helping to induce rolling blackouts.

Subject: liberal defnitions
Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.
The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.
As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.
Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.
And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

If you said mind-numbing, rights destroying, cynic-making force, I'd

I'm bitter atm.  Two reasons mostly:
1) I was listening to what I heard being the First Amendment

amendment goes too far.   And (their quote was 1 in 5, but I'm finding

or my setup issues.
First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.
Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.
Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).
Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro
NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.
Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.
In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.
That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.
Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.
The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.
His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.
No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.
The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.
When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.
Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.
But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

Most of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League
dropouts suggesting to me that they weren't exactly poor to start
with.
   
Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...
 
Sure - discussion in Forbes - rigorous research, that. Especially when 
the data in their own list
contradicts them. I continue to look at the list and all the ""inherited, 
growed"" entries. I guess if
I read it enough times my vision will clear.
[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]
The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.
Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.
 
I, at on point, looked into Stanford Business School. After learning 
that tuition was > 20K,
no financial aid was available, and part-time work was disallowed, this 
smart person decided
that I was not willing to spend the $150 application fee 
(non-refundable). During attendance at
my local business school, I was told repeatedly I should have gone for 
it - to quote a prof, (Northwestern MBA), it
has nothing to do with the education you receive - in general European 
(and Canadian) business
schools are better and more innovative - its the connections. He used 
the words ""American nobility.""
Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.
 
""invented"" being the right word. Dubya went to Yale and HBS. I guess 
""practically"" gets you
around that problem.
The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.
BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.
[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]
 
Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
centers that
have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
to this is that many college graduates
 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
that we are the thin edge
(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
third-world wages and work practices coming
 to North America.
I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
could maintain that (and prosper) just says
 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
place.
And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
the labor markets here.
BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.
That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...
 
Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
produce profits for the favored few.
In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.
To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.
 
I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
and lie - use
the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.
And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
standards of living) is the reality.
Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:
""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
the top 20% of households""

I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for
24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of
code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to
maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  
For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.
I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.
Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops,
there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".
This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)

better yet would be a built-in server check on a periodic basis, even

this would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up

right Mike,
i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is
only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant
show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am
mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.
my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways
once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see
amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on
their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just
that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family
life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion
of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of
their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of
photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes
things 'big time'.
rgds,
rob

While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same
argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who
communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is
such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find
yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?
I don't buy it.
For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient
mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not
nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and
such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to
get a message across.
misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the
plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital
camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.
Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just
don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this"").  I wasn't saying
that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't
easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way
that ""changed the face of communications"".
I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why
people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the
phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see
people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to
other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over
sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or
offline) photoalbum.
I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics
right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's
one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant
view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want
""instant view"", but also ""instant show"".  Which is what this service
offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"".  I think
people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put
together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while
they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but
it's just ""nice"" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral
messaging method.
What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it
from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's
silly if people are going to flock to it.
I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.
The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately
are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event
will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile
phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of
what happened - before the press even gets there.
Willing to be proven wrong,
Mike
PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as
they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.",433,ham

   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.
   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
you can make and test predictions.
   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
admin's job would be a lot harder.

| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
| 
| On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
| itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
| anyone else.
| 
| If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
| 
| At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
| known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
| vulnerability, if possible.  
| 
| This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
| disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
| was.
| 
| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
| exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
| disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
| underground, vulnerable.
| 
| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
| long as possible.
| 
| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
| 
| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
| HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
| information.
| 
| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
| together, add up to a catastrophe.
| 
| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
| 
| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
| --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
| 
| I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
| 
| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
| 
| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
| Samba, for example.
| 
| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
| increase the availability of that information to the people who can
| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
| 
| Let's not let that happen.

| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
| 
| 
| Greetings,
| 
| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
| 
| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
| 
| Q. How will it work?
| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
| of motivations, including the following:
| 
|          * Pure love of security research
|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
| 
| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
| items:
| 
|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
|          * The potential severity level for the information shared
|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
|            software and hardware potentially affected
|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE
| 
| Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
| entity.
| 
| Q. Why are you launching this program?
| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
| public at large are warned in a timely manner.
| 
| Q. Who gets the credit?
| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
| exploit information.
| 
| Q. When can I contribute?
| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
| 
| To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 
    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 
    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

You have not explained why the increase in CO2 concentrations is not
contributing to increasing global temperature.
There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to
controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not
be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning:
Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a
fairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an
authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.
With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle
peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this
cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete
cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and
time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it
happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other
words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we
would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
concentrations.
Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
feedback systems mentioned above.
Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
biosphere.
CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't
think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in
understanding warming trends.

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
By Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT
DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.
The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.
According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.
""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""
Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.
In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.
""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""
Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.
According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.
""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.
The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.
The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.
In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.
DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.
=======================================================================
DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.
Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.
Today, XG3™ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.
DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding
Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPower’s Board of 
Directors.
DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and
sales of the company’s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking.
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the world’s first intelligent XML 
networking devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPower’s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3™) technology.
""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPower’s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.
""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML that’s critical to Web
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
servers—breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.
""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPower’s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPower’s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""
""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3) technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""
""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPower’s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely
on XML for mission critical applications.""

Because mortgage rates are rising.
As a National Lender, not a broker, we can
guarantee you the lowest possible rate on your
home loan.
Rates may well never be this low again. This is
your chance to secure a better future. You could
literally save enough money to buy that new car
you've been wanting or to take that special
vacation. Why pay more than you have to pay?
We can guarantee you the best rate and the best
deal possible for you. But only if you act now.
This is a free service. No fees of any kind.
 
You can easily determine if we can help you in
just a few short minutes. We only provide
information in terms so simple that anyone can
understand them. We promise that you won't need
an attorney to see the savings.
 
We offer both first and second home loans and we
will be happy to show you why your current loan
is the best for you. 0r why you should replace
it.
Once again, there's no risk for you. None at all.

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

""I don't take no stocks in mathematics, anyway"" --Huckleberry Finn",426,ham
ham,"OK, let's bring some data into the discussion:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm
(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature
fluctuations over the past 400k years).
Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
causative.
Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation
between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to
be causal.
With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.
Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.
As it
happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data.
Not correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and
<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2
concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded
value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing
at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the
Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine
resolution).
In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,
No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm
(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record"").
Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok
record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.
There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for
anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating
this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.
but it looks a lot like we
would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
concentrations.
Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past
400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly
spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the
spike might not show up in the ice cores).
Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that
even you would have a hard time arguing away.
Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
feedback systems mentioned above.
Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a
finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase,
but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be
enormous.
Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
biosphere.
Correct.
Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm
Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial
levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also
a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly
anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in
methane levels as well.
Data on water vapor here:
http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/mockler.html
CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.
I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in
reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,
wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources
of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense
(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve
reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic --
Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate
change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last
year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and
improved efficiency is an easy sell.

ham,"All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the
square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I 
really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I
think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of
the atmosphere trails off.
Chemistry types have a method for
dealing with this question without
dragging in the calculus:
Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly
affected by gravity, resulting in
the potential energy for a mass M
to be linear in height h: Mgh.
What relative concentrations will
we have when two different packets
of air are in equilibrium?
If they are at the same height, we
will have half the mass in one, and
half the mass in the other, and the
amount flowing from one to the other
balances the amount flowing in the
opposite direction.[0]
If they are at differing heights,
then a greater percentage of the
higher air tends to descend than
that percentage of the lower air
which ascends.  In order for the
two flows to balance, the higher
packet must contain less air than
the lower, and the mass balance
of the flows corresponds thusly:
    high percentage of thin air
    ---------------------------
    low percentage of dense air
Now, rates are exponential in
energy differences[1], so that
theoretically we should expect
an exponential decay in height,
to compensate.  How does it go
in practice?

Which is ""a feature"" from Graham's POV:  the more clues, the better this
""smoking guns only"" approach should work.
I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it
rolls
over and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages.  Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use.  Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call
that an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

Close encounter of burnt kind
IT came from outer space ­ or did it? Teenager Siobhan Cowton is convinced
the object which struck her as she climbed into the family car at her home
in Northallerton is extra-terrestrial.
But while her claims are being treated with a certain amount of studied
academic scepticism by experts in these matters, the 14-year-old schoolgirl
is adamant she was hit on the foot by a meteorite.
Siobhan initially thought there was a more prosaic explanation ­ that the
odd-looking stone had been thrown at her by a child,.
But on closer inspection, she discovered all was not as it seemed ­ because
it was hot when she picked it up. It hit her on a foot but caused no injury.
""I looked at it again and it had a black and grey colour with a shiny bubble
surface,"" she said.
After closer inspection by her father Niel, and comparison with pictures on
the Internet, Siobhan plans to ask scientists at Durham University to check
the object for authenticity.
If it is from outer space, Siobhan says she will consider putting it up for
auction.
She added: ""If it isn't worth anything then I suppose I will keep it myself
for sentimental value. It is not every day that you are hit by a meteorite.""
But Dr Ben Horton, a lecturer in physical geography, was the acme of
academic caution.
""Meteors have features that can be used to establish whether it is a piece
of extraterrestrial rock,"" he said.
""They have a very smooth surface but sometimes they have shallow depressions
and cavities. If they are hot, they should have a black ash like crust burnt
around the edge.
""Most are between five and 60 centimetres but five centimetres is the
smallest that they usually appear.""
To establish the provenance of Siobhan's suspected meteorite it would have
to be subject to a mineral breakdown but Dr Horton thinks the chances of it
being extra-terrestrial are slim.
""Around 50,000 a year strike the Earth's surface and, considering the size
of the Earth, it is very unlikely to be a meteorite.
""However, there is a possibility and there is no reason it couldn't happen,""
he added.

I downloaded and played with it a bit, but had no time to do anything
systematic.
Cool!
It correctly recognized a spam that slipped through SA.
Ditto.
But it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
MIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved 'zope
geeks' list that happened to be using MIME and/or HTML.
Do you know why?  The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIME
independent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain'
in that pickle is under 0.21.  'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets
0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more
than cancel it out.
WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:
1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.
2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),
   so that the tags aren't getting stripped.  The pickled classifier
   despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.
3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the
   latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for
   example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just
   says something like ""This is an HMTL message."").
If it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize()
meaning ""even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway"".  In fact, I'd like
to do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists
strikes me as, umm, extreme <wink>.
So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).
That would be a different experiment.  I'm certainly curious to see whether

SEC EXPOSES BIG BLUE'S PINK SLIPS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Does the Securities and Exchange Commission have a press pass
yet? It seems to be bringing us all our news lately. On the day
of the deadline for companies to certify their financial
statements with the SEC, the business press squirmed and waited
for the next Enron or WorldCom. (We might eat these words
tomorrow, but we doubt it.) In an unrelated confession, IBM gave 
the commission its latest layoff numbers.
IBM talked about pink slips during its second-quarter earnings
report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope.
(""Capricorn: Career changes may be on their way..."") Only after
""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit
that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the AP. That's
about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. 
An IBM spokesperson told the Wall Street Journal the higher
number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than expected 
taking voluntary layoffs. 
Sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" Did IBM ""rightsize""
last quarter, too?
IBM's news was still trickling out Wednesday morning, but some
details were available. About 1,400 workers got cut from IBM's
microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from IT
services and consulting. (That ought to make IBM's new employees 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)
Look for news updates from cities that will see the cuts, such
as Austin and Raleigh. 
OK, none of this is good. Two years into the tech slump, we're
still tired of seeing people get sacked. But was it really so
bad that IBM only revealed it because of new accounting
regulations? Nah, Big Blue was always known for ""stealth
layoffs,"" as CNN put it, but current corporate scrutiny forced
it to 'fess up for once. Until now, IBM would acknowledge the
latest layoffs if reporters called and asked, but wouldn't give
specifics. Yeesh. - Jen Muehlbauer

SYNERGY AND BETRAYAL AT VIVENDI
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Synergy always was a fuzzy concept. Now Vivendi Universal's top
man has slammed the lid on it. The French company announced
today that it's ready to peddle $9.8 billion in assets to rustle 
up some cash. First up on the block? Synergy-less U.S. book
publisher Houghton Mifflin. 
It's unclear whether new chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou has genuine
turnaround muscle, or whether he and Vivendi's board are simply
following the winds of post-merger fashion. But when you owe
$18.7 billion, you get real practical, real fast. The Guardian
reported that Vivendi's share price sank 5% on Tuesday when
investors got the willies about the company's impending
announcement on its financial health. But the company had
positive news to report: It's making money. Revenue in the first 
half was up 13%, higher than analysts' estimates of a 7.7%
boost. 
Details are scant on the breadth of Fourtou's restructuring
efforts, with more information expected at the next board
meeting on September 25, according to reporters. Houghton
Mifflin, acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion, and a vague
explanation that included the ""Curious George"" character, were
the only properties named for sale so far. The Guardian
speculated that Vivendi will also sell its U.S. video games
business and possibly its stake in the French mobile phone
company SFR, a debatable sale because of the cash it generates,
according to the newspaper. 
Meanwhile, Fourtou's predecessor, Jean-Marie Messier, continues
to advocate empire-building. The New York Post said its sources
say Messier hopes his former employer will feel generous enough
to let him continue to reside in his $17 million Manhattan
abode. And Bloomberg reported earlier this week that an
unrepentant Messier is penning a memoir as he vacations in the
Mediterranean. The working title? ""How I Was Betrayed.""  -

    told me that she only liked me as a friend.
09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who

10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to

11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was
    born.
12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of
    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.
13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me
    find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find
    them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can
    hide.""
14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.
15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how
    big I'd get.
16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and
    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong
    with me?"" He said...  ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.""
17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping
    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.
18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my
    kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff.
19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves
    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on

It did for me, but I am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as
other apps seemed to work OK for cut and paste and Tk does its
clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. So I'm not
about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.
One more salvo on X and cut/paste.  X specifies at least two *mechanisms*
for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintosh
have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quite
sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.
The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection
on your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit
Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.
However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is
another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)
by versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these
mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.
I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.

I CVS'ed the unseen/Sequences changes and installed them, and have only one 
real issue.

I use the unseen window rather than the exmh icon, and with the new code
I can't seem to be able to.  How many unseen when when I have the main window open
is not really necessary.
hmmm, I stole the code from unseenwin, but I never tested it since I don't use 
that functionality.  Consider it on my list of things to check.

My wife noticed something odd.  The nearly-full moon was about 30
degrees above the horizon.  There was a notable glow on the horizon,
except under the moon.  The moon seemed to be in a column of darkness
that was about three times the apparent width of the moon.  We could see
the column over its entire length as a strip of sky darker than the sky
around it.
Any of you ever see this?  Do you have any idea what could have caused
it?  I suspect it's due to some pecularity of the visual system, but
have no clear idea.
I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.
I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

Yes, them too.  When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf
into a quarry and then throw rocks from the surrounding cliffs so
that ""no one will know who killed the wolf""

In Samskar, before the Chinese arrived, there had not been a killing
in over 2000 years, and the last recorded skirmish, over rights to
a water hole, had happened several generations ago.
I'm skeptical.  
One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
in popular culture.
I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.

ham,"Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of 
today’s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by 
centralization.
Generically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one 
answer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate 
agents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific 
context of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid 
value at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) 
according to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more 
slowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the 
basis for today’s most popular architectural style for developing 
network applications: client-server interaction using request-response 
communication protocols.
I believe these are profound limitations, which we are already 
encountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the 
beholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the 
separate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, 
unfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a 
centralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a 
third example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as 
abstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these 
limits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and 
communication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light 
and human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized 
information representation, and hence centralized software architecture.",222,spam
ham,"However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on
UNIX as they are on Windows platform for two main reasons:
1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...)
are respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software
they need: the reputation matters.
2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this
software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and
open source.

I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, a family lawyer to our former military rule,General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power some years ago. Since his untimely demise, the family has suffered a lot of harassment from the regimes that succeeded him.  The regime and even the present civilian government are made up of Abacha's enemies.Recently, the wife was banned from traveling outside Kano State their home state as a kind of house arrest and the eldest son still in detention.Although, a lot of money have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her husband by the present government, there's still huge sums of money in hard currencies that we have been able to move out of the country for safe keeping to the tune of US$50 million.This money US$50 Million is already in North American and if you are interested,we will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total funds,and you will share 25% of the total funds after clearance from the Security Company.
Note, there is no risk involved in this project because l am involved as Abacha's confidant.Please you should keep this transaction a top secret and we are prepared to do more business with you pending your approach towards this project.I await your urgent response.Thanks.
Yours Faithfully

Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get 
in. Anything else would require a redesign, and would in nontrivial 
thermal engineering issues.
A number of vendors are putting the Promise IDE hardware on the
motherboard.  All that remains is the proper drive socket.
I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware
EIDE RAID.
Additionally, you can get hardware IDE raid as a pair of drive bays or
even an IDE-IDEx2 controller that can be screwed into a 1U chassis.

down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.
Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing
and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these
people.
question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way.
And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested
in stroking their pathetic egos?
OBTW, 'clueless social moron syndrom' does not have political boundaries.

    ENRON Corp material assets go on the block 7 AM CT TOMORROW, Wednesday, 
    9/25. First on the list is the giant, steel, Enron ""E"" (Lot ""E""), followed 
    by tons of cool tech. 50 inch plasma panels, desktop LC Displays, boxes of 
    Palm PDAs or Nokia cell phones, network stuff, wireless stuff, desktop 
    computers, servers, monitors, printers, plotters, in both massive lots, and 
    individually! Oh yeah, Enron trade-show trinkets too, by the cartload. 
    The catch: You have to either go to Texas to pick up the stuff, or arrange 
    with an approved 3rd party vendor (list provided on the web site) to have 
    it picked, packed and shipped for you. 
    Go! Register! Bid! Consume!

I'd say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted. Maybe trying ""apt-get
clean"" to remove all downloaded files first would solve the problem.

Another area for potentially fruitful study:  it's clear that the
highest-value indicators usually appear ""early"" in msgs, and for spam
there's an actual reason for that:  advertising has to strive
to get your attention early.  So, for example, if we only bothered to
tokenize the first 90% of a msg, would results get worse?
[Neil Schemenauer]
Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning
of the message.  In pratice that would probably work fine.
Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).
Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.
But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

   1. It is easy to enable the bytecode interpreter.
   2. This noticeably improves rendering of non-antialiased text.
   3. This noticeably *harms* rendering of antialiased text.
Point #3 probably surprises the rest of you as much as it surprised me. 
  Ever since turning on the bytecode interpreter, I've been bugged by a 
sense that the antialiased text in my GNOME2 applications just looked, 
well, wrong somehow.  I finally took some comparison screen shots with 
and without the interpreter, and that made the difference crystal clear.
Consider the two images attached below.  The first, ""no-bytecodes.png"", 
shows some text rendered by a GNOME2 panel menu without the bytecode 
interpreter.  Contrast this with the second, ""bytecodes.png"", taken with 
the bytecode interpreter enabled.
When the bytecode interpreter is turned on, notice that several 
rendering anomalies appear:
   - Several letters are narrower, giving the whole run of text a more
     compressed feel.  This is especially noticeable in ""R"" and ""o"".
   - The left side of the ""Q"" is painted in too light a shade of grey,
     causing it to drop out somewhat.  ""C"", not in this sample, has the
     same problem.
   - ""Qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient
     whitespace between them.
   - ""M"" is distinctly asymmetric.
   - The enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled
     with grey.  Contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode
     interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop.
Ick.  Perhaps this is why Red Hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. 
It may improve non-antialiased rendering, but only at the expense of 
making a mess of antialiased rendering.
This may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, 
I'm going back to Red Hat's standard packages with the bytecode 
interpreter turned *off*.",2628,ham

COMMENTARY
Rebuild at Ground Zero
By LARRY SILVERSTEIN
Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the
horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who
perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers
and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic
amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish
that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,
indeed, for all of us.
But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square
feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers
must be replaced on the site.
About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,
along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.
Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the
economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%
of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms
have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New
York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit
may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.
If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the
vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,
and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers
made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a
symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were
destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and
with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.
In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many
sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on
all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square
feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or
simply never rebuilt.
These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be
recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over
the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the
office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.
Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.
That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy
before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has
remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway
and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements
planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct
""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes
even more the logical locus of office development.
And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task
force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60
million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the
anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only
heightens the need.
As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown
cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that
history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of
office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased
up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the
beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,
at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.
We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site
over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on
line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an
annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'
rate.
Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it
previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an
extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor
will most New Yorkers.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times
that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the
future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --
and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural
significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what
happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as
residents of the area.
The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.
Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm
whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.

DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. 
*Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 
*Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 
Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 
*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.",1345,spam

Hello again. I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at
the end of it, everything still goes smoothly until I type ""make""
after I get the output from the ./configure. 

However, there were a couple of things I noticed along the way. After typing 
* cp configs/kernel-2.4...config .config
* make oldconfig
* make dep
The 2nd to last line I got back said that the modversions.h file was
not updated. When I looked at this path to the modversions.h file, it
was 281 lines and every line started with a # mark.
Is it the case
that nothing is read on a line after a # mark (or am I just thinking
of another language?) and so should I delete the # at certain places?
No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer,
but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are
instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile
process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions
e.g. ""#include <math.h>"" gives you maths type functions.  Since they
start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation.
Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.
Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.
I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).
For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful
compilation.
m

Also, when I was in the pctel directory and typed ""make"", I noticed
that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions.h
file. Inside this other file, there's nothing at all. And so I moved
the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file
- and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the
file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33:
linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37:
linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36:
linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory

The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are
what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be
a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file)
that I'd have to compile/make?

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again.
Do you really think this is true?  I added a modify time check thinking that 
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in 
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.
On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache 
when that happens anyway.
Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a 
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  My code is in proc MhReadSeqs.

... This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions

	Although the data might just be the information that needs protecting.
Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept?
	I've seen this implemented for a shell server, although they chose
to have their root on a CD-WR in a CD-R drive. Which meant that even
when compromised it was only possible to examine other users data.

Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.
Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.
D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""
Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.
The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.
Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.
""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do

Subject: [Razor-users] Reducing impact from tons of email
I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.
I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)
At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?
Any ideas would be welcome.
Thanks,
Joe

Using satellites to monitor global climate change

SUMMARY
As part of an ongoing NASA/UAH joint project, Dr. John Christy of UAH and Dr. Roy Spencer of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center use data gathered by microwave sounding units (MSUs) on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration TIROS-N satellites to get accurate, direct measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the Earth, including remote deserts, rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available.
The accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since January 1979 has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data. A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.
Once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a ""public"" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
GATHERING THE DATA
While traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.
The MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their ""brightness"" - varies according to temperature.
Christy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.
VERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS
A recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a ""remarkable"" level of agreement between the two.
To verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by ""radiosonde"" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.
He found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.
""The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" Christy said. ""If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.""
The 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.
Globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.
""These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" Christy said. ""They are not representative of the total globe.""
Radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.
While there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.
In an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.
GLOBAL COVERAGE
One advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.
The 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.
The most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.
Most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.
The ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.
Temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""Radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.
While balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.
Water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.
In the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.
INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU
With nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.
Each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.
Because the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)
To check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.
INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS
Of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.
INSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY
While the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.
The thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.
Only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.
THE SCIENTISTS
In 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society's Special Award. They were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the Earth's temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.""
AMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.
In 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA's Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.
DR. JOHN CHRISTY
Christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.
He was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.
He also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.
Christy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA's Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an ""invited key contributor"" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.
DR. ROY SPENCER
Spencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.
He is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues. Spencer is lead author on sixteen scientific papers.

Bob,
    Living aboard a Cessna 172 would be challenging, but I did meet a
couple at an airshow in Point Mugu in 1995 or so that had converted an
old seaplane (it was a bit larger than a PBY, I think) to something of a
floating, flying RV.  They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of
miles.  I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two
large radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price
range, but what a hoot!
    On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2
hours of flight time at about  $75/hour in the Cessna.  Not exactly a
cheap date, but that's nothing compared to the money I've spent on her
since.  (And loved every minute of it, Darling!!)

Just as long as they have the wherewithal
for avgas, anyway.
I think Turpin once calculated that one
could do a decent amount of messing about
for about $30K of boat and $12K/year in
living expenses.
What are the equivalent figures for live
aboard aircraft?

They have an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as
trusted hardware ?
SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.
That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).
As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.
